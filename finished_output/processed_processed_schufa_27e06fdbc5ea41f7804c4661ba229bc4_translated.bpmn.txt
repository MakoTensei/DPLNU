 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Request to the Schufa' task, which then proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway connects to the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which in turn leads to the'sid-70E1B44E-A1DA-4C89-BB3D-B5B09B143367'. Following this, the 'Level 1 scoring' task connects to the'sid-3AB495E1-D64A-4B1C-8485-4CBC65AB203D', which is the endpoint for 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Level 1 scoring' task directly, bypassing the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then connects to the 'Level2 scoring' task, which leads to'sid-70E1B44E-A1DA-4C89-BB3D-B5B09B143367'. The 'Level2 scoring' task also connects to 'EndEvent1' through the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1' tasks both lead to the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which then diverges into two separate paths. The 'Level 1 scoring' task connects to'sid-70E1B44E-A1DA-4C89-BB3D-B5B09B14337' for both paths, and finally, both paths converge at 'EndEvent1' through the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
