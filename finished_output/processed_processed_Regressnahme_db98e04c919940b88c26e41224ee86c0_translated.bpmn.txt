 In response to a possible regression, the team initiates a series of tasks to ensure the integrity of the process. First, they check the case to identify any potential issues, which is then directed to ExclusiveGateway4. Concurrently, a message is sent to monitor the receipt of payment, also routing through ExclusiveGateway4. To address the opposition, the team monitors the receipt of payment and sends a message, both of which are also directed to ExclusiveGateway4.


When the payment and report are received, the process is closed, and the team proceeds to the debt collection process if the opposition is justified. This task is also routed through ExclusiveGateway4. If the opposition is not justified, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway3.


The ExclusiveGateway3 then leads to the transfer of the process to debt collection if the opposition is justified, or to the proceedings if the opposition is not justified. Both of these outcomes are directed to ExclusiveGateway4.


The ExclusiveGateway4, in turn, sends the process to Close the process, finalizing the workflow. This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures that the team can effectively manage and respond to possible regressions and opposition in the process.
