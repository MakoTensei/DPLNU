 In the credit lending frontend, the process begins with a request from Schufa, which triggers the Button Pressure in Credit Award task. This task is responsible for presenting the scoring results to the user.

Next, a Scoring Request is made, which initiates the process of sending a scoring request to the Schufa-system. This request is handled by the Send Scoring Request to Schufa-system task.

As the scoring process unfolds, the Scoring Slows Down task is triggered, indicating a delay in the scoring process. This task is linked to the Info Scoring Changes in Credit Lending event, which communicates any changes in the scoring process to the relevant stakeholders.

The Scoring Result in Credit Delivery task is responsible for presenting the scoring results to the user. This task has two outgoing connections: EndEvent0 and Presentation of Scoring in Credit Lending Frontend.

The ExclusiveGateway0 task, triggered by the Scoring Conduct LEVEL 1 event, handles the slower scoring process and communicates with the Info Scoring Changes in Credit Lending event.

The ParallelGateway1 task, triggered by the Scoring Conduct LEVEL 1 event, manages the presentation of scoring results and communicates with the EndEvent3 and Scoring Slows Down events.

In summary, the credit lending frontend involves various tasks and events that handle the presentation of scoring results, communication of changes in the scoring process, and management of slower scoring scenarios.
