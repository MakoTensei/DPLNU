 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and understandable way:

1. The guest feels hungry, so they decide to visit a restaurant.
2. Upon arrival, the guest is directed to a line to wait for their turn.
3. Once it's the guest's turn, they place their order with the restaurant staff.
4. The staff processes the order and prepares the food.
5. The guest receives their order, which is ready to go.
6. The guest pays for their order at the cash register.
7. The staff picks up the order and delivers it to the guest.
8. The guest enjoys their meal.
9. After finishing their meal, the guest is ready to leave the restaurant.
