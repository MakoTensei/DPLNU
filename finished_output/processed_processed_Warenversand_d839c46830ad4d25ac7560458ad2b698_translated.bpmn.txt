 The process begins with the Secretariat receiving a StartEvent0, which triggers the collection of offers from three carriers through ExclusiveGateway2. Once the offers are collected, the Secretariat fills out standardized parcel notes and determines if insurance is required, passing this information through ExclusiveGateway0 to ExclusiveGateway4.

ParallelGateway5 then receives the StartEvent0 and sends the collected offers to ExclusiveGateway2. The Secretariat clarifies the insurance requirement, which is passed through ExclusiveGateway0 to ExclusiveGateway4. The Logistics Manager locks the insurance, which is communicated through ExclusiveGateway1 to ExclusiveGateway4.

The Secretariat then accepts the offers from the carriers, with Offer 1 going through ExclusiveGateway3, and Offers 2 and 3 also passing through ExclusiveGateway3. Warehouse workers receive the offers from ParallelGateway5 and pack the goods for collection, which is communicated through ExclusiveGateway5 to Warehouse workers providing goods for collection.

In summary, the process involves the Secretariat collecting offers, filling out parcel notes, clarifying insurance requirements, and accepting offers from carriers. The warehouse workers then package the goods for collection based on the accepted offers.
