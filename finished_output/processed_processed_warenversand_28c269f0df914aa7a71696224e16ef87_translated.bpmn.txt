 In the shipping process, there are several tasks that need to be completed in a specific order. First, the shipping mode needs to be cleared, which requires the 'ParallelGateway4'. Once the shipping mode is cleared, the packaging paper needs to be filled in, which also requires 'ParallelGateway4'. After the packaging paper is filled, the customer is presented with three offers, and the 'Special delivery necessary?' gateway is triggered, which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the customer decides that a special delivery is necessary, the 'ParallelGateway4' is used again to deliver the goods.

If the customer chooses not to have a special delivery, the 'Insurance not needed?' gateway is triggered, which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If the customer decides that insurance is not needed, the 'ParallelGateway4' is used again to deliver the goods.

Once the goods are delivered, the packaging is inspected, and the 'ParallelGateway4' is used again to deliver the goods. The packaging process is completed by filling in the packaging paper, which requires 'ParallelGateway5'. 'ParallelGateway6' is used twice to deliver the goods. Finally, the goods are delivered, and the process ends.

In summary, the shipping process involves clearing the shipping mode, filling in the packaging paper, presenting offers, deciding on special delivery, insurance, and delivering the goods. The process uses various gateways and start/end events to ensure a smooth and efficient shipping process.
