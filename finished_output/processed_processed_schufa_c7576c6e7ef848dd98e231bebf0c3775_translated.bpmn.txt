 The workflow begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'inform sales staff' task. This task is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn leads to the 'Edible\ninformed' task.

Next, the 'Scoring\nstarted' event initiates the 'First level?' task, which has two outgoing connections: 'Result\nGranted' and 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Result\nGranted' task is triggered by the 'Determine Final Scoringergbenis' task, while the 'ParallelGateway3' task is triggered by the 'Determining scoring' task.

The 'Determine Final Scoringergbenis' task is also connected to the 'Edible\ninformed' task, which is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway3' task.

The 'Delay\nReport' event triggers the 'ParallelGateway3' task, which in turn leads to the 'Edible\ninformed' task.

Finally, the 'Edible\ninformed' task is triggered by both 'EventBasedGateway1' and 'Result\nGranted' tasks, and it marks the end of the workflow.
