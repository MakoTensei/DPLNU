 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive way:

1. When a customer feels hungry, they trigger the "Hunger" event.
2. The system responds by offering a "Search Resaurant" option.
3. The customer selects the "Choose your order" option.
4. The customer then places their order, which is processed and leads to the "Payment" stage.
5. The payment is completed, and the customer receives their "Pieper" (food) to pick up.
6. The customer retrieves their food from the kitchen, and the "Guest information" is updated, indicating that the food is ready.
7. The customer is then welcomed and asked to enter their order in cash.
8. The cash is collected, and the order is sent to the kitchen.
9. The kitchen prepares the food, and the "Food ready" status is updated.
10. The customer is notified that their food is ready, and they are directed to retrieve their food.
11. The customer retrieves their food, and the "EndEvent1" is triggered.
12. The "EventBasedGateway0" receives the "Food ready" status and directs the customer to the next step, which is to welcome them and receive their order.
13. The customer enters their order in cash, and the "Cash" status is updated.
14. The "Cash" is sent to the kitchen, and the "Pieper over" status is updated.
15. The kitchen receives the order and prepares the food, leading to the "Food ready" status.
16. The "Guest information" is updated, and the customer is notified that their food is ready.
17. The customer retrieves their food, and the "EndEvent1" is triggered.
18. The "EventBasedGateway0" receives the "EndEvent1" status and directs the customer to the next step, which is to accept the order.
19. The kitchen starts cooking the food, and the "Submit food" status is updated.
20. The cooked food is ready, and the "EndEvent2" is triggered.
