 In the scoring process, a request for obtaining Schufa data is initiated, which triggers a series of events and interactions between various gateways and tasks.

1. The process begins with the 'Schufaanfrag\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'Results obtained' task. This task sends the obtained results to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which then dispatches the results to the 'Result sent' event.

2. Concurrently, a 'Scoring request\nobtained' event triggers the 'Send result to bank' task. This task sends the obtained results to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which dispatches the results to the 'Result sent' event.

3. The 'Scoring successful?' event is triggered by the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event. It sends the obtained results to the'sid-81A6DE3D-1B17-44DE-BD99-740B3D1EEA63' task, which dispatches the results to the 'L1 scoring\ndispatched' event.

4. The 'Send result to bank' task is triggered by the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event. It sends the obtained results to the'sid-B1F144F8-3C21-476A-9727-7F2FCF4AD74B' gateway, which dispatches the results to the 'Result sent' event twice.

5. The 'Level 1 scoring\nperform' task is triggered by the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event. It sends the obtained results to the'sid-37007118-587E-4ABD-8362-88A74F26EB6F' gateway, which dispatches the 'L1 scoring\ndispatched' event.

6. The 'Level 2 scoring\nperform' task is triggered by the 'Level 2 scoring\nperform' event. It sends the obtained results to the'sid-B5D52E3C-92FE-49F2-B1
