 Let's describe the workflow in a more natural and flowing description:

1. A guest feels hungry, triggering the process to enter a restaurant and select a court.
2. The guest waits in line until it's their turn.
3. Once the guest is in line, they add their order to the system.
4. The system processes the order and prompts the guest to pay for their meal.
5. After payment, the guest receives a Pieper (a food item) and waits for it to be ready.
6. The restaurant's employees are informed about the meal preparation.
7. The meal is prepared and put in abundance.
8. The restaurant's employees are informed that the meal is ready.
9. The guest is notified that their food is ready, and they appear at the restaurant.
10. The guest picks up their food and starts eating.
11. After finishing their meal, the guest experiences satisfaction (famine) and the process ends.

Gateways:

1. When the guest feels hungry and is waiting for the food to be ready, the system triggers the EventBasedGateway0, which either ends the process or sets a timer for 5 minutes.
2. If the guest is waiting in line, the system triggers the famine event, which ends the process.

Start Events:

1. The guest feels hungry, initiating the process to enter a restaurant and select a court.
2. The guest gives their order, prompting the retrieval of the guest.
3. The restaurant prepares the meal, informing the employees.

End Events:

1. The guest experiences satisfaction (famine) after eating, ending the process.
2. The process ends when the EventBasedGateway0 is triggered, either by the guest's food being ready or after 5 minutes.
3. The process ends when the guest is retrieved after giving their order.
