 Let's start the process by initiating a business request. Upon receiving the request, a delay is reported, and the process is temporarily paused. Meanwhile, a request for Schufaservice is made, and the system checks if direct scoring is possible.

Once the delay is reported, the process resumes, and the system determines the scoring level 1. The scoring result arrives, and the process concludes with the end of event 2.

During the process, intermediate events are triggered to handle specific situations. For instance, when the delay is reported, IntermediateCatchEvent6 is triggered to handle the Schufaservice request. Similarly, when the request for Schufaservice is made, IntermediateCatchEvent5 is triggered.

The process also involves gateways that determine the flow of the process. For example, the EventBasedGateway1 checks if direct scoring is possible and sends the scoring result to the end of event 0. EventBasedGateway2 handles the end of event 1, and EventBasedGateway1 handles the scoring result arrival.

In summary, the process starts with a business request, followed by a delay report, a request for Schufaservice, and a determination of scoring level 1. The process concludes with the end of event 2, and intermediate events and gateways help manage the flow and handle specific situations.
