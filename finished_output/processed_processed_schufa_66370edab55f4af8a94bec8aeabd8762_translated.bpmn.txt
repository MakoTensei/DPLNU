 The process begins with the 'Schufa process Start' event, which triggers the 'Sufa Request' event. This request leads to the 'Results available?' event, which in turn connects to the 'Scoring Level 1' task. The 'Scoring Level 1' task, upon completion, sends the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'EventBasedGateway3' event then connects to the 'Scoring Level 2' task, which is initiated after the 'Scoring Level 1' task is completed. The 'Scoring Level 2' task sends the results to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then triggers the 'Scoring complete' event. The 'Scoring complete' event is the final step in the process, signifying the completion of the scoring process.
