 In the scoring process, a Request initiates the sequence, triggering the Start Event 'Request' (sid-DAB9413E-2A7B-4638-AEFE-213CB058AF03). This request leads to the Scoring request and Start task (sid-1FAECA61-209E-47F5-AB59-CFB1C49332B0), which then sends a Delay signal (sid-2845CE1C-FDC9-4E11-86A4-BD5B34B3B378) to determine the scoring.

The Delay task (sid-2845CE1C-FDC9-4E11-86A4-BD5B34B3B378) sends a Delay signal to the Determining scoring Level 2 task (sid-1F0164F5-3B99-412B-8C48-0D8C44148959), which in turn sends a request to the Determining scoring Level 2 task (sid-1B4D72E2-EB22-4726-A728-00A207F15DB9).

The Determining scoring Level 2 task (sid-1B4D72E2-EB22-4726-A728-00A207F15DB9) sends a request to the Scoring Level 2 task (sid-1F0164F5-3B99-412B-8C48-0D8C44148959), which then sends a request to the Report scoring task (sid-B7704966-557F-49C5-A4CF-397826635D53).

The Report scoring task (sid-B7704966-557F-49C5-A4CF-397826
