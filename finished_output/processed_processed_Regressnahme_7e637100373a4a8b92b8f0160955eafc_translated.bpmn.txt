 The process begins with the 'Regress' event, which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to initiate the 'Set process for resubmission' task. The 'Set process for resubmission' task then triggers the 'Incoming payment' task, which in turn leads to the 'Close' task. The 'Close' task is followed by the 'EndEvent2' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Regress' event also triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' task, which sends a 'Date of expiry' message. This message leads to the 'EndEvent3' task.

The 'Set process for resubmission' task also triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which leads to the 'EndEvent2' task.

The 'Incoming payment' task triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which leads to the 'EndEvent3' task.

The 'Opposition' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which leads to the 'EndEvent2' task.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Regress' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'EndEvent3' task.
