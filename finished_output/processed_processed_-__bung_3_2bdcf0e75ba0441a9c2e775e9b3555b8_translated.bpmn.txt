 In the workflow, the process begins with the 'Regression report' event, which triggers the 'Check the case' task. This task then sends a message to 'Send a message' and also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Following this, the 'Money received' event leads to the 'Book the entrance' task, which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'VN repeats' event triggers the 'Examination' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, the 'Can regression be taken?' event initiates the 'Debt collection' task, which sends a message to 'Debt collection\ndelivered' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Regression report' event also connects to 'EventBasedGateway4', which sends a message to 'Debt collection\ndelivered' and 'Complete the process'. The 'Payments.\njustified?' event connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3', while 'EventBasedGateway4' sends messages to 'Debt collection', 'Complete the process', and 'Payments.\njustified?'.

The 'Refund period\nExpired' event connects to 'Debt collection\ndelivered', and the 'Regression report' event also connects to 'Money received', which leads to the 'Complete the process' task.

Finally, the process concludes with the 'Regression\nFinished' event, which is triggered by the 'Money received' event and has no outgoing connections. Similarly, the 'Debt collection\ndelivered' event, triggered by the 'Can regression be taken?' event, also has no outgoing connections.
