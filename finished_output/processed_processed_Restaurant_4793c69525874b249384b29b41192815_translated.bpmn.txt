 A hungry customer decides to visit a restaurant and places an order. The restaurant's system processes the order, and the customer waits for the employees to prepare the meal. Once the meal is ready, the customer receives it and enjoys their food.

Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. The customer feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant. The system receives an 'hungry' event, triggering the 'Add your order' task.
2. The customer fills out an 'Order form' and submits it to the restaurant. The system receives an 'Order form' event, triggering the 'Start your order' task.
3. The restaurant's employees prepare the meal, which involves milling preparation. The system receives a 'Milling preparation' event, triggering the 'Putting a meal on a medium' task.
4. The meal is ready, and the restaurant's system sends a'meal ready' event to the customer.
5. The customer receives the meal and enjoys their food.

During this process, the following events and tasks are triggered:

- 'hungry' event triggers 'Add your order' task.
- 'Order form' event triggers 'Start your order' task.
- 'Milling preparation' event triggers 'Putting a meal on a medium' task.

The system also uses gateways to manage the flow of events:

- 'EventBasedGateway1' receives 'hungry' and'sid-8DEEA450-B8C8-4E2C-92E8-6C6CFD0644B6' events, triggering the 'Famine' task.
- 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives 'Pieper piept' event, triggering the 'Famine' and'meal ready' tasks.

The process ends with the 'Famine' and'meal ready' events, indicating that the customer's hunger has been satisfied, and the meal has been prepared and served.
