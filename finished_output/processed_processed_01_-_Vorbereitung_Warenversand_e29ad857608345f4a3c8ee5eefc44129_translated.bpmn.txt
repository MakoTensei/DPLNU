 The process begins with the 'Order Report' event, which triggers the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task, leading to the 'Pick up offers' task. The 'Specialist' task is then initiated, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway further leads to the 'ParallelGateway5' task, which is responsible for 'Filling the package note'. The 'Insurance' task is also triggered, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and subsequently to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway4' task, which is initiated by the 'Order Report', connects to 'Pick up offers' and 'ParallelGateway5'. Finally, the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event is triggered, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'. This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures the smooth processing of orders, from clearing the shipping mode to dispatching the goods.
