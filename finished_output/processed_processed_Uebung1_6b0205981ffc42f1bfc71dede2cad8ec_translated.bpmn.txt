 The process begins with the event 'Something to be sent', which triggers the task 'Offer 1' to be initiated. 'Offer 1' is a request for a quote from a forwarder, and it has an incoming link to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Once 'Offer 1' is processed, the system evaluates whether a special shipment is necessary. This decision is made by the task 'Is special shipment necessary?' which has an incoming link from 'Offer 1' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway4'.

If a special shipment is deemed necessary, the system proceeds to 'Pick up offers from forwarders' task, which has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The system then evaluates the offers received and chooses the cheapest one. This task, 'Choose the cheapest offer', has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The chosen offer is then procured, which is the task 'Procure a spearhead'. This task has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway5' and an outgoing link to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The goods are then packaged, which is the task 'Packaging goods'. This task has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway6' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway7'.

The packaged goods are then insured, which is the task 'Check insurance'. This task has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway7' and an outgoing link to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the insurance is not possible, the system handles the insolvency situation. This is the task 'Insolvency', which has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway7' and an outgoing link to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

If the product cannot be insured, the system provides the goods for collection. This is the task 'Provide goods for collection', which has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4' and an outgoing link to 'Goods shipped'.
