 Upon receiving an order, the system initiates the packaging process by sending the order details to ParallelGateway5. If the order quantity is large, the system checks this using ExclusiveGateway4. Once the order is confirmed, the system proceeds to pack the goods and sends the packaging details to ExclusiveGateway0.

ParallelGateway0 then forwards the packaging details to ExclusiveGateway3, which determines if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, the system sends the request to ExclusiveGateway2, which handles the insurance process.

ParallelGateway5 also sends the order details to ExclusiveGateway2 for creating an inquiry for spediteurs. This inquiry is then forwarded to ExclusiveGateway6, which selects the appropriate freight forwarder.

Once the goods are packaged and insurance is determined, the system sends the goods for collection to Provide goods for collection.

For normal mail orders, the system sends the order details to ExclusiveGateway4, which fills out the standing parcel certificate and sends it to ExclusiveGateway3.

If the order quantity is large, the system sends the packaging details to ExclusiveGateway4, which checks if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, the system sends the request to ExclusiveGateway2, which handles the insurance process.

In summary, the system processes orders by packaging the goods, determining if insurance is required, creating inquiries for spediteurs, and selecting freight forwarders. The goods are then sent for collection or handled as normal mail orders.
