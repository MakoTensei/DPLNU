 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the creation of a Level 1 message, which is then routed to 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway generates a delay message and sends it to 'Scoringergeb.\nis 2', while also forwarding the original request to 'Delay message\n?'. The delay message is caught by 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', which in turn sends it to 'IntermediateCatchEvent6'. Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway2' also sends a Level 1 message to'sid-BCCB6A67-FF28-48EF-A88B-E9CD950F353B'.

Simultaneously, 'Schufascoring\nCustomer Service' initiates the process by creating a note to the frontend and sending a notification to 'EndEvent2' and'sid-BDE061EC-72B9-4249-8F5A-502326BF2F29'. The frontend is also informed about the Scoring request and the subsequent Conduct Level 1 creation.

The 'EndEvent0' concludes the process by receiving the Level 1 message from 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'EndEvent2' is triggered by 'IntermediateCatchEvent6', which receives the delay message from 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. This marks the end of the scoring process, with all necessary messages and notifications being sent to their respective destinations.
