 When a product is ordered, the process begins with the 'Product ordered' event, which triggers the 'Goods\nPickup\nprovide' task. This task is responsible for packaging the goods and preparing them for pickup. The incoming gateway for this task is 'ParallelGateway5', which receives the 'Product ordered' event. Once the goods are packaged, they are shipped, leading to the 'Goods shipped' event. This event is triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' task, which ensures that the goods are insured before shipping. The 'Complete insurance' task is responsible for this, and it also receives the 'ParallelGateway5' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods\nPickup\nprovide' task also triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' event, which in turn leads to the 'Big crowd?' task. This task is responsible for filling value-added goods notices for a large crowd. The 'Big crowd?' task receives the 'ParallelGateway5' event and sends out the 'Value\nGoods\nnotice' task. The 'Value\nGoods\nnotice' task is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for handling the notice for the large crowd.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Product ordered' event, leading to the 'Goods\nPickup\nprovide' task, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' event. This event then leads to the 'Big crowd?' task, which sends the 'Value\nGoods\nnotice' task to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'Insurance necessary?' task ensures that the goods are insured before shipping, leading to the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task sends the 'Goods shipped' event, which is the end of the process.
