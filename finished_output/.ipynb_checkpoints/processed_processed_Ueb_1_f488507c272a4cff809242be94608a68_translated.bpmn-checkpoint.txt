 The process begins with obtaining shipping costs, which triggers the task of delivering goods. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5' and leads to the 'Delivering goods' task. Once the shipping costs are obtained, the 'Check quantity' task is initiated, which is linked to 'ParallelGateway4' and results in '3 offers'. From the '3 offers' task, one selection is made, leading to the 'Specialist' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' task then leads to the 'Shipping costs\nFinished' task, which is an end event.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' task also triggers the 'Check insurance requirements' task, which is connected to 'big crowd?'. This task leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn leads to the 'Shipping costs\nFinished' task.

The 'Complete insurance' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', also leads to 'Shipping costs\nFinished'.

In summary, the process involves obtaining shipping costs, checking quantity, making a selection, and checking insurance requirements, all of which lead to the final event of 'Shipping costs\nFinished'.
