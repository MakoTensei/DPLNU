 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive way:

1. A customer feels hungry, triggering the "Hunger Felt" event.
2. The customer selects a court from the menu, leading to the "Select a Court" event.
3. The customer adds their order, which initiates the "Add Your Order" event.
4. The restaurant retrieves the guest, resulting in the "Retrieve Guest" event.
5. The kitchen receives the cooking order, starting the "Cooking Order Received" event.
6. The kitchen staff is informed about the cooking order, leading to the "Inform Employees" event.
7. The cooking order is completed, triggering the "Cooking Order Finished" event.
8. The customer's hunger is satisfied, and they feel "Hunger Distilled," marking the end of the "Hunger Distilled" event.
9. The restaurant processes the order, resulting in the "Order Processed" event.
10. The customer's order is ready, and they are notified, completing the "Order Published" event.

This flow of events captures the customer's journey from feeling hungry to having their order processed and served.
