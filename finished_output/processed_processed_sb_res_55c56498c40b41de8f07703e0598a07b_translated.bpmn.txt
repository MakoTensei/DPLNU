 The process begins with the customer feeling hunger, triggering the 'Hunger felt' event. This leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1', where the customer's hunger is distilled.

Next, the customer places an order, which triggers the 'Order' event. This event leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', where the order is processed.

The cook receives the order, which triggers the 'Cook receives Order' event. This event leads to the 'Food in Perennial' event, where the food is prepared and ready to be served.

The food is then provided to the customer, which triggers the 'Provide food' event. This event leads to the '5 minutes' event, where the customer waits for their food.

After the food is served, the customer leaves the restaurant, triggering the 'Leave food' event. This event leads to the 'Order completed' event, indicating that the order has been successfully fulfilled.

Finally, the customer's hunger is distilled, and the order is completed, marking the end of the process.
