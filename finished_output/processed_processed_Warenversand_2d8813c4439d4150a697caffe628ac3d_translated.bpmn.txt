 The process begins with the 'Order Shipment' event, which triggers the packaging of goods. This event connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn initiates the 'Goods packaging' process. The packaged goods are then sent to 'ParallelGateway2' for preparation for collection.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway5' also checks if special delivery is necessary. If it is, the goods are sent to 'Special delivery\nnecessary?' for size separation. The separated goods are then sent to 'ParallelGateway2' for further processing.

Meanwhile, the 'Order Shipment' event also triggers the 'Goods ready for collection' process, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway3'. This process prepares the goods for collection and sends them to 'ParallelGateway2' for shipping.

The 'Special delivery\nnecessary?' event checks if special delivery is needed. If it is, the goods are sent to 'Shipping of the request\nSpedition 1' for reporting. The report is then sent to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Goods ready for collection' process also connects to 'Shipping of the request\nSpedition 1' for reporting. The report is then sent to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'ParallelGateway2' processes the goods for shipping and sends them to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Special delivery\nnecessary?' event also connects to 'EndEvent0' for completion.

In summary, the 'Order Shipment' event triggers a series of processes involving packaging, size separation, preparation for collection, and shipping. These processes are interconnected through various gateways, ensuring a smooth flow of goods from order to delivery.
