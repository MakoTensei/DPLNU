 The process begins when a Vendor (VN) reports a regression, which is an event that triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure proper handling of the situation.

1. The first task, identified by the ID'sid-973D0B3D-F412-49AD-85F8-BA58365B6A56', is initiated when the VN reports a regression. This task has no incoming events but sets the process in motion by sending a 'VN payment request' to the next gateway.

2. The 'VN payment request' task, with the ID'sid-0DFD6CAC-CB01-4107-BD93-45086C1AAD03', is designed to handle the situation when the VN reports a regression. It has an incoming event from the 'VN reported in Regress' task and sets the process for resubmission as its outgoing event.

3. The 'Set process for resubmission' task, with the ID'sid-843A721D-0020-407D-9D80-3F6DF0395A16', is triggered by the 'VN payment request' task. It has an incoming event from the 'VN in Regress?' task and sends an outgoing event to the 'VN contradicts' task.

4. The 'VN contradicts' task, with the ID'sid-ED5FE563-206B-4E34-B877-CE54F3437686', is initiated by the 'Set process for resubmission' task. It has an incoming event from the 'VN in Regress?' task and sends an outgoing event to the 'Proceedings\n' gateway.

5. The 'Proceedings\n' gateway, with the ID'sid-81D90288-5BEE-4CE7-90B5-406472F4A59B', is triggered by the 'VN contradicts' task. It has incoming events from both the 'VN
