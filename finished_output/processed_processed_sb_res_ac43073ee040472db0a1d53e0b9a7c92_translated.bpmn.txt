In a more natural flow:

1. A customer feels hungry, triggering the event "Hunger felt."
2. The system recognizes the hunger and sends an event to "Employee is ready," preparing the employee to fulfill the order.
3. The employee then places an order for the court of justice, initiating the event "Order the Court."
4. The court of justice receives the order, and the event "Order obtained" is triggered.
5. The court processes the order and prepares the food, leading to the event "Food ready."
6. The food is ready, and the event "Order completed" is triggered, informing the employees.
7. The employees are informed about the completed order, and the event "Order completed" is finalized.
8. The customer's hunger is satisfied, and the event "Hunger" is resolved.
