 In a bustling logistics hub, a series of tasks are orchestrated through a network of gateways to ensure the seamless flow of goods and services. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the initiation of the logistics sequence.

The first task, 'Determination of quantity', is handled by 'ExclusiveGateway2', which receives inputs from 'StartEvent0' and directs the flow towards 'ParallelGateway6'. This gateway then sends out 'Offer 1' and 'Provide goods for collection' tasks.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway6' also receives inputs from 'StartEvent0' and sends out 'Offer 1' and 'Provide goods for collection' tasks.

The 'Filling the package note' task, with the ID'sid-868716D8-B2B0-4F16-BF06-6BD74B7D4A1F', is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and subsequently to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is crucial in ensuring that the package is properly documented and ready for shipping.

Meanwhile, 'Complete insurance' with the ID'sid-CC95C79C-411B-471F-B042-000E93B7F919' is also directed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task ensures that the goods are insured during transit, providing peace of mind to both the sender and the receiver.

The 'Offer 1' and 'Offer 2' tasks, with IDs'sid-73D45E1D-91EE-46EC-A5E4-BB9521C333C2' and'sid-53216784-25DE-458C-BD60-CBAC8EA5AF03' respectively, are directed to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ParallelGateway5'. These tasks involve presenting attractive offers to potential clients
