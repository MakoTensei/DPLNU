 In the scoring process, a request for scoring is initiated, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The process begins with a 'Scoring request\nReport' event, which leads to the 'Continue Level2 scoring' task. This task is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn sends a 'Get delay message' to the 'Get delay message' task. The 'Get delay message' task then triggers the 'forward delay' task, which eventually results in a 'Level 2 scoring result'. This result is then sent back to the 'Continue Level2 scoring' task, which sends another 'Scoring request' to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' event also triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring Report' task, which sends a 'Schufa request processed' message to the 'Result?' gateway. The 'Result?' gateway then sends a 'Schufa request processed' message back to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of tasks and gateways that work together to process scoring requests, handle delays, and generate scoring reports. The process starts with a 'Scoring request\nReport' event, which triggers a chain of tasks and gateways, ultimately resulting in a 'Level 2 scoring result' and a 'Schufa request processed' message.
