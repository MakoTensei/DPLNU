 In a system designed to handle scoring requests and results, various tasks and gateways work together to ensure efficient communication and processing. Here's a natural flow description of the system's operations:

1. When a scoring request is obtained, the system initiates the process by sending a 'Send delay proof' message to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway is responsible for handling the delay proof and forwarding the request to the appropriate level of scoring.

2. Concurrently, another scoring request is received, and the system sends a 'Report delay' message to the 'Delay\nReport' gateway. This gateway is responsible for reporting any delays in the scoring process.

3. The 'EventBasedGateway2' receives the scoring request and forwards it to the 'Level2 scoring' gateway. This gateway processes the request and generates the 'Scoring\nResult\navailable' message.

4. The 'Scoring\nResult\navailable' message is then sent to the 'Result\n?' gateway, which is responsible for reporting the result back to the system.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Conduct Level1 scoring' message and the 'Result\navailable' message. It then sends the 'Result\nReported back' message to the system.

6. The 'Scoring\nResult\nsupplied' message is sent from the 'Level2 scoring' gateway to the 'Delay\nReport' gateway, which reports any delays in the scoring process.

7. Finally, the 'Result\nReported back' message is sent from the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to the system, indicating that the scoring process has been completed and the result has been reported.

In summary, the system efficiently handles scoring requests and results by utilizing various gateways and tasks to ensure smooth communication and processing.
