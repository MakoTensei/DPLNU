 The process begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the selection of a shipping method using the quantity, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then directs the process to the 'Type of shipping?' gateways, where the user is prompted to choose the shipping method. The selected shipping method leads to the 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn connects to the 'Supplying goods for shipping' task.

Once the goods are supplied for shipping, the process moves to the 'Insurance\nnecessary?' gateways, where the user is asked if insurance is necessary. If the user chooses to have insurance, the process continues to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which connects to the 'Order selected freight forwarders' task. This task involves selecting freight forwarders based on the chosen shipping method.

The 'Order selected freight forwarders' task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to the 'Filling the package note' task. This task involves filling the necessary package notes for the selected freight forwarders.

After the package notes are filled, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which connects to the 'Goods\npackaging' task. This task involves packaging the goods for shipping based on the selected shipping method.

Finally, the 'Goods\npackaging' task connects to the 'End' event, which signifies the completion of the shipping process.
