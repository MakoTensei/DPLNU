 In the shipping process, goods are first picked up by a specialist, who is tasked with handling the shipping goods. This specialist is connected to ExclusiveGateway0, which also receives incoming traffic from ParallelGateway6. Once the goods are picked up, they are handed over to Spediteur, which is facilitated by ExclusiveGateway2, receiving traffic from ExclusiveGateway1.

After the goods are handed over to Spediteur, they are then shipped by Post, which is facilitated by ExclusiveGateway4, receiving traffic from ExclusiveGateway2. The goods are then shipped to the final destination, as indicated by the end event 'Goods shipped' with incoming traffic from ExclusiveGateway1.

Throughout this process, the goods are also insured, as indicated by the 'Insurance close' event, which is facilitated by ExclusiveGateway3, receiving traffic from ExclusiveGateway1.

In summary, the shipping process involves a series of gateways and events, including the specialist, Spediteur, and Post, to ensure the safe and timely delivery of the goods.
