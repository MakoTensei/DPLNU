 When shipping goods, the process begins with the 'Shipping goods' start event, which triggers the 'Is insurance necessary?' task to determine if insurance is required. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is initiated. Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway4' receives the incoming traffic from 'Shipping goods' and directs it to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the traffic to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway2' handles the 'Filling the package note' task, which is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is essential for preparing the package note before shipping.

Once the package note is filled, 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends the traffic to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn directs it to 'ParallelGateway5'. 'ParallelGateway5' is responsible for selecting the appropriate offer for the customer, which is facilitated by the 'Select your offer' task.

After the offer is selected, the 'Specialist' task is triggered, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The specialist handles any specific queries or issues related to the selected offer.

Finally, 'ParallelGateway5' sends the traffic to the 'Deliver goods for collection' task, which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway5' and 'EndEvent0'. This task ensures that the goods are delivered to the customer for collection.

In summary, the process of shipping goods involves determining the necessity of insurance, filling the package note, selecting an offer, and delivering the goods for collection, all while coordinating the flow of traffic through various gateways and tasks.
