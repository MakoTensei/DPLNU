 When a 'Regressive thought' event occurs, it triggers a series of processes and interactions between various tasks and gateways. Firstly, the 'Regressive thought' event is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for handling such events. From there, 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the event to 'Process for debt collection service providers' and 'Proceedings', both of which have 'Regressive thought' as their incoming event.

Meanwhile, 'EventBasedGateway4' also receives the 'Regressive thought' event and sends it to 'Process for debt collection service providers' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. 'ExclusiveGateway1' then forwards the event to 'Test' and 'Book payment receipt', both of which have 'Regressive thought' as their incoming event.

The 'Test' task, with the ID'sid-E5666EDA-E50C-4BEA-B23B-56B1DFDF5274', and the 'Book payment receipt' task, with the ID'sid-22A9D2CA-500C-4AFD-8CA3-EE21A55A468F', both have 'Regressive thought' as their incoming event.

Additionally, 'Suspicion confirmed?' gateway, with the ID'sid-C36FE033-B2FE-4678-80CF-76451CB26756', receives the 'Regressive thought' event and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Not justified' gateway, with the ID'sid-71FA3161-19C3-4A9F-A7CD-EFE058F085BF'. The 'Not justified' gateway sends the event to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn sends it to 'Process'.
