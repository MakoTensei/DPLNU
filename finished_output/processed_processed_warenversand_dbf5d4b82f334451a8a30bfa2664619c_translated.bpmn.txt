 When a shipment is initiated, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the following sequence of events:

1. The 'Small quantity\nStandard shipping' gateway receives the 'StartEvent0' and routes the task to the 'normal mail, secretariat' and 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'normal mail, secretariat' gateway handles the task of determining who takes delivery of the shipment, while 'ParallelGateway4' manages the logistics of the shipment.

2. If the shipment is large, the 'Large quantity' gateway is activated, which also routes the task to 'ParallelGateway4'.

3. The 'Insurance\nnecessary?' gateway is triggered to determine if insurance is required for the shipment. If insurance is necessary, the 'Standard package' gateway is activated to handle the packaging and insurance of the goods.

4. The 'Goods are packaged.' task is initiated, which is handled by the 'Goods are collected' gateway. This gateway collects the goods and prepares them for delivery.

5. Finally, the 'EndEvent0' is triggered, which signifies the completion of the shipment process. The 'Make a selection!' task is also initiated, allowing the recipient to choose the delivery method.

In summary, the shipment process begins with the 'StartEvent0' and involves multiple gateways and tasks to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of the goods.
