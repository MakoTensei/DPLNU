 In the scoring process, the first step involves the 'Scoring results is there?' gateway, which receives incoming requests from the 'Schufa scoring required' event and directs them to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then forwards the requests to both 'Level 1 scoring performed' and 'Level 2 scoring performed' tasks. The 'Level 1 scoring performed' task, identified by'sid-5B4B7799-6971-45EF-A17F-41E4D6F750E3', and the 'Level 2 scoring performed' task, identified by'sid-5407BBF1-A95C-4972-A6B6-F934D705E574', both send their outcomes to the 'Scoring carried out' task, identified by'sid-1C0DA01F-352C-47E7-9F14-56E9C89D567F'. The 'Scoring results is there?' gateway also sends its outcomes to the 'Schufa scoring completed' task, identified by'sid-17A537B5-9538-453B-ABB8-50A601921656', and the 'Delay Report obtained' gateway, identified by'sid-0620C68F-7E8A-4398-B22A-C05C035378D2'. The process concludes with the 'Schufa scoring completed' task and the 'Scoring carried out' task, identified by'sid-68A19BD7-A73E-426F-9AC9-FB3B525AE8EC' and'sid-26B51A3F-306E-4E2B-A6F6-3F8B818CD238', respectively.
