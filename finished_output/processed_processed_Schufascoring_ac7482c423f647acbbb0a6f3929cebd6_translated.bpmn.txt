 In the process of handling Schufa requests and scoring, the system follows a series of interconnected tasks and gateways.

1. The process begins with the 'Pick up Schufascoring' event, which triggers the 'Continue to the Frontend' task. This task is responsible for forwarding the request to the frontend.

2. The 'Schufa request' event initiates the 'Transfer scoring level 1' task. This task transfers the request to the scoring process.

3. The 'Scoring Level 1 reported' event triggers the 'Scoring ends' task, which concludes the scoring process for level 1.

4. The 'Identification level 1 possible?' event leads to the 'Report delay to the frontend' task, which communicates a delay to the frontend.

5. The 'Scoring Level 2 reported' event triggers the 'Scoring ends' task, which concludes the scoring process for level 2.

6. The 'Identification level 1 possible?' event also leads to the 'Scoring Level 2 finished' task, which finalizes the scoring process for level 2.

The system also includes gateways that manage the flow of information between tasks. For example, the 'Identification level 1 possible?' gateway connects the 'Schufa request' task to the 'Scoring Level 2 finished' and 'Scoring ends' tasks.

Overall, the system efficiently processes Schufa requests, performs scoring, and communicates the results to the frontend, ensuring a smooth and accurate credit assessment process.
