 In the banking system, the process of scoring a Schufa request begins with the 'Request scoring' event, which triggers the forwarding of a delay message to the 'forward the delay message' task. This task is responsible for communicating any delays encountered during the Schufa request to the appropriate parties.

Once the delay message is forwarded, the 'Schufaauskunft requested' event initiates the process of obtaining the Schufa data. This event triggers the 'Report result to Bank' task, which sends the Schufa data to the bank for further processing.

The 'Schufaauskunft requested' event also triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which performs the initial scoring based on the Schufa data. The task then sends the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' event, which determines whether the scoring should proceed to the next level or not.

If the scoring proceeds, the 'perform scoring level 2' task is triggered, which takes a few minutes to complete the second level of scoring. Once the second level of scoring is completed, the 'Scoring result' task is triggered, which sends the final scoring results to the 'Report Scoringergebns to Bank' task.

The 'Report Scoringergebns to Bank' task then sends the final scoring results to the bank, and the 'Scoring ends' event is triggered, marking the completion of the scoring process.

Throughout this process, the 'EventBasedGateway1' event handles the routing of messages between tasks, ensuring that the correct tasks are triggered based on the incoming and outgoing messages.

In summary, the banking system processes Schufa requests by first obtaining the Schufa data, performing initial and second-level scoring, and then sending the final scoring results to the bank for further processing. The process is managed by a series of tasks and events, with the 'EventBasedGateway1' event ensuring proper message routing.
