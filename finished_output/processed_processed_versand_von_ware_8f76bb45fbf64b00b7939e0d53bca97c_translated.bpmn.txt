 In a seamless flow of tasks and gateways, the process begins with the 'you should be sent' start event, which triggers the 'offer' task (sid-D0BC2E03-F7A4-4150-9D2B-A28C81589B98) that requires a quantity input. This task connects to the 'quantity?' gateway (sid-8600D9FF-DF25-4C53-881E-17C9A214BA9F), which in turn leads to the 'insurance necessary?' task (sid-CF56144E-9669-47C5-B732-E28CF2E4DDDC). The 'insurance necessary?' task then connects to the 'EndEvent1' (sid-49F2873E-0D67-41D3-AB94-D7DD0CFAF454) and the 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-0E593FD6-4422-4107-A7FA-368B394956CA), which also links to the 'ware to provide collection' task (sid-BFFABFAF-915D-423E-8DC9-E8C3BB84BA19) and the 'fill in the package' task (sid-sid-32931433-952B-48F6-99E6-BA42EAE922C3). The 'ware to provide collection' task then connects to the 'EndEvent1' (sid-49F2873E-0D67-41D3-AB94-D7DD0CFAF454), completing the process.
