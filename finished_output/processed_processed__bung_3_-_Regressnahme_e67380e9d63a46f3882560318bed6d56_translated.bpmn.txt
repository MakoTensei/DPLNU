 When a possible regression is detected, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, a message is sent to notify the team about the potential regression, which is routed through ExclusiveGateway1. Concurrently, the system checks for any debt service providers that may need deletion, which is also directed to ExclusiveGateway1.

Meanwhile, the system also proceeds with the booking of payments, which is directed to ExclusiveGateway2. If the booking of payments is successful, the system closes the process, sending the outcome to ExclusiveGateway3.

If the possible regression is confirmed, the system sets the task for re-submission, which is routed through ExclusiveGateway0. This task is then sent to ExclusiveGateway1 for further processing.

In summary, the system handles a possible regression by sending a message, checking for debt service provider deletion, booking payments, and setting the task for re-submission, all while routing these tasks through the appropriate ExclusiveGateways.
