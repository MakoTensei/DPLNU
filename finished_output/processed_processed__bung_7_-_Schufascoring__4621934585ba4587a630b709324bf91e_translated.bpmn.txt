 In the world of event-driven communication, a series of tasks and gateways work together to facilitate the scoring process. Let's dive into the flow of this system:

When the 'StartEvent0' occurs, it triggers the 'Start Communication' task, which initiates the process by sending a message to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. This event, in turn, leads to the 'Scoring' task, which begins the scoring process.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1', which sends a message to the 'Scoring ends' task. This task is responsible for ending the scoring process once it's completed.

As the 'Scoring' task progresses, it sends a message to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which also sends a message to the 'Scoring ends' task, further ensuring the scoring process is properly concluded.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Continue scoring result Level 2' task, which continues the scoring process at Level 2. This task sends a message to the 'Scoring ends' task, ensuring the process is properly concluded.

The 'Scoring' task also sends a message to the 'Scoring available' gateway, which in turn sends a message to the 'Scoring' task, allowing it to continue the scoring process.

The 'Scoring' task also sends a message to the 'Create a message Result Level 2' task, which creates a message with the result of the scoring process at Level 2.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task, upon receiving a message from the 'Start Communication' task, sends a message to the 'Scoring ends' task, ensuring the scoring process is properly concluded.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' task, upon receiving a message from the 'StartEvent0', sends a message to the 'Scoring ends' task, ensuring the scoring process is properly concluded.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, upon receiving a message from the 'StartEvent0', sends a message to the 'Decrease\nforward info' task, which decreases the forward information.

The 'Inter
