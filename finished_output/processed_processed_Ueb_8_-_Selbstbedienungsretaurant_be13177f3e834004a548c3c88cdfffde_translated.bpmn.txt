 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and cohesive way:

1. A guest feels hungry, triggering the event "Hunger felt."
2. The guest decides to visit a restaurant, initiating the event "Visit the restaurant."
3. Upon arrival, the guest places an order, leading to the event "Order obtained."
4. The restaurant processes the order, resulting in the event "Add your order."
5. The kitchen prepares the meal, causing the event "Cooking order obtained."
6. The kitchen informs the employees about the cooking order, leading to the event "Inform employees."
7. The meal is cooked and ready to be served, triggering the event "Cooking order completed."
8. The guest receives their meal, causing the event "Pieper triggered."
9. The guest eats the meal, resulting in the event "Eat meal."
10. The guest's hunger is satisfied, leading to the event "Hunger distilled."
11. The guest leaves the restaurant, triggering the event "Leave food."
12. The restaurant completes the order, resulting in the event "Order completed."

This flow of events connects the tasks and gateways in a logical and understandable manner.
