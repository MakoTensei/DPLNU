 In a seamless workflow, the following tasks are orchestrated to handle scoring inquiries and results:

1. When a scoring inquiry is required by the bank, the process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' start event. This event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to forward the request to the appropriate service.

2. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends the request to 'EventBasedGateway3', which is responsible for handling the incoming 'Scoring\nRequired' event.

3. 'EventBasedGateway3' processes the request and, if necessary, sends a 'Notice of delay' event to inform the bank about any potential delays in the scoring process.

4. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring\nRequired' event also triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which receives the request from the bank and forwards the results to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

5. 'ExclusiveGateway2' then directs the 'Level 1 Scoring' results to 'EndEvent1', which signifies the completion of the first level of scoring.

6. If the 'Results Level 1\navailable?' event is received by 'ExclusiveGateway2', it triggers the 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which processes the results and sends the final scoring result to 'EndEvent1'.

7. The 'Scoring result' task, initiated by the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, sends the inquiry to 'Schufa' and, upon receiving the results, forwards them to the 'frontend' through 'EndEvent0'.

8. If a delay is reported, the 'Notice of delay' event is sent to the bank, and the 'Report delay' event is triggered, which then initiates the 'Level 2 Scoring' task.

9. The 'Level 2 Scoring' task processes the results and sends them back to 'EndEvent1' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

10. Finally, the 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' events mark the completion of the respective processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient scoring workflow.
