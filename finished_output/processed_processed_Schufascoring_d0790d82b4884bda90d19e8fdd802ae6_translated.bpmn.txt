 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Prepare request' task, which then sends an outgoing message to'sid-2D4DC08E-39AA-46B2-9FDA-2BDD0DD16A9E'. Following this, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which sends an outgoing message to 'EndEvent1' and receives an incoming message from 'Get Level 1 scoring'. The 'Result fixed' gateway, triggered by 'StartEvent1', sends an outgoing message to 'EndEvent1' and'sid-49559CCD-FD48-43D4-AC64-DF201DA00B3A'. 

Next, 'Get Level 1 scoring' receives an incoming message from 'EventBasedGateway1' and forwards an outgoing message to 'Information forwarded'. The 'final scoring delays' gateway, triggered by 'EventBasedGateway1', sends an outgoing message to'sid-B7850104-87EF-48B6-AA3E-7EADA3BB84C3' and receives an incoming message from 'Get Level 2 scoring'. 

Simultaneously, 'Get Level 2 scoring' receives an incoming message from'sid-28120FFD-AAD4-4E05-B0B8-BF60F84C04AE' and forwards an outgoing message to 'Information forwarded'. Finally, 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent2' receive incoming messages from 'Level 1 Scoring' and 'Level 2 Scoring' respectively, and have no outgoing messages.
