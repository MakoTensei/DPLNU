 In the world of scoring and reporting, various tasks and gateways work together to ensure a smooth process. Let's dive into the flow of this system:

When a scoring request with a report arrives, it triggers a 'Report delay' task, which sends the report to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway then forwards the report to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which processes the report and sends a 'Scoring obtained' message to the 'Scoring\nobtained' gateway.

Meanwhile, the 'Schufa request\nReport' task also triggers a 'Report delay' task, which sends the report to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway forwards the report to the 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which processes the report and sends a 'Scoring request\nFinished' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Scoring request\nFinished' message and sends it to the 'Scoring request\nFinished' task, which marks the completion of the scoring process.

Additionally, the 'Result\npresent?' gateway receives the 'Schufa request\nReport' and 'Level 2 Scoring' messages, and sends the 'Scoring request\nFinished' message to the 'Scoring request\nFinished' task.

In summary, the system handles scoring requests and reports by passing them through various tasks and gateways, ensuring that the scoring process is completed efficiently and accurately.
