 The process begins with the 'we should be sending' event, which triggers the packaging task with ParallelGateway3 as its incoming gateway. This task is responsible for preparing the goods for shipping. Once the packaging is complete, the goods are sent to Delivery for shipping, which is the outgoing gateway of the packaging task.

Simultaneously, the 'we should be sending' event also triggers the Merging order rejected and goods task with ParallelGateway3 as its incoming gateway. This task handles the scenario where an order is rejected and the goods need to be managed accordingly. The outgoing gateway for this task is Goods are wide for shipping.

The Delivery for shipping task, upon completion, sends the goods to ExclusiveGateway0. This exclusive gateway then routes the goods to ParallelGateway4, which is the outgoing gateway for the Merging order rejected and goods task.

The ParallelGateway4 task, upon completion, sends the goods to Goods are wide for shipping, which is the outgoing gateway for the Complete insurance task.

The Complete insurance task, triggered by the 'Insurance?' event, handles the insurance process for the goods. Upon completion, it sends the goods to ExclusiveGateway2.

Finally, ExclusiveGateway2 routes the goods to ParallelGateway4, which sends the goods to Goods are wide for shipping, marking the end of the process.
