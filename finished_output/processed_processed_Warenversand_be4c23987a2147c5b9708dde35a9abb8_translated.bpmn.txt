 The workflow begins with a Start event, which triggers a clarification process to determine who will take delivery. This is handled by the 'clarification, who takes delivery' task, which has an incoming trigger from the Start event and an outgoing connection to the ExclusiveGateway0.

Once the clarification is complete, the workflow proceeds to the 'to get offers' task. This task is triggered by the ExclusiveGateway0 and connects to the Special shipment? task, which in turn connects to the ParallelGateway6.

Following this, the 'Spedition 1 offer' task is initiated, which is triggered by the Special shipment? task and connects to the ExclusiveGateway2. This task is followed by the 'Spedition 2' task, which is also triggered by the ExclusiveGateway2 and connects to the ExclusiveGateway3.

The 'Selection' task is then triggered by the ParallelGateway6, which connects to the ExclusiveGateway3. This task is followed by the 'Ordering the selected forwarding' task, which is triggered by the ExclusiveGateway3 and connects to the ExclusiveGateway5.

The 'Filling the package note' task is then initiated, which is triggered by the ExclusiveGateway3 and connects to the ExclusiveGateway5. Finally, the 'Packaging goods' task is triggered, which is triggered by the ParallelGateway6 and connects to the EndEvent0.

The workflow concludes with the EndEvent0, which is triggered by the ParallelGateway6 and has no outgoing connections.
