 When a claim of regress is received, it is first directed to ExclusiveGateway1, where it is checked for justification. If the objection is justified, the process is closed, and the claim is forwarded to ExclusiveGateway3, which keeps the process open. Concurrently, if the objection is not justified, the claim proceeds to Regression right? Gateway, which sends a message to Time past and continues the process. Meanwhile, if the claim is justified, the process is closed, and the claim is forwarded to ExclusiveGateway1. Additionally, if the claim is not justified, the claim is also forwarded to ExclusiveGateway1. In the case of an incoming payment, it is directed to ExclusiveGateway1, which then sends a message to Time past and continues the process.
