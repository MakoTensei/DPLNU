 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event, which triggers the 'Schufascoring\nreceive immediately' task. This task is responsible for handling the incoming request and initiating the scoring process.

Once the scoring request is received, the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event occurs, leading to the 'Delay\nReport' task. This task is responsible for reporting any delays in the scoring process.

As the scoring process progresses, the 'Schufascore\nobtained' event is triggered, which then sends the score to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' task. This task is responsible for sending the score report to the appropriate destination.

The 'Schufascore\nReport' event is then triggered, indicating that the score has been reported. This event triggers the 'Scoring\ncarried out' task, which completes the scoring process.

Finally, the 'Schufascore\nReport' event is triggered, signaling the completion of the reporting process.

In summary, the process involves the following sequence of events and tasks:

1. 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event triggers 'Schufascoring\nreceive immediately' task.
2. 'Scoring request\nobtained' event triggers 'Delay\nReport' task.
3. 'Schufascore\nobtained' event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway0' task.
4. 'Schufascore\nReport' event triggers 'Scoring\ncarried out' task.
5. 'Schufascore\nReport' event signals the completion of the reporting process.
