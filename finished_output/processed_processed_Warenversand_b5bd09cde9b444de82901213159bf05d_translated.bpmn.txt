 When an order is received, the process begins with the 'Order received' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which then leads to the 'Pick up offers' task. Upon receiving the offer, the 'Select your offer' task is initiated, which is linked to the 'Special shipment?' gateway. This gateway connects to the 'Specialist' task, which in turn leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' is responsible for handling the 'Special shipment?' task, which then connects to the 'Filling the package note' task. This task is linked to the 'ParallelGateway4' and leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' handles the 'Filling the package note' and 'Insurance?' tasks, which then connect to the 'Goods\nPickup\nready' event.

In summary, the order received event triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Goods\nPickup\nready' event, where the goods are ready for pickup.
