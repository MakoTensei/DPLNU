 Upon receiving a "Report Regression," the system initiates a case study to address the regression issue. This case study involves creating and sending a payment request to Vietnam (VN) for a cash receipt, which is then booked as a payment receipt. Concurrently, the system also proceeds with the regressive challenge, which is a decision-making point that can lead to either the "Process" or "Process completed" outcomes.


The regressive challenge is managed by a gateway that evaluates the "Report Regression" and directs the flow to either the "Process" or "Process completed" based on the evaluation. If the regressive challenge leads to the "Process," the system will continue to the "Proceedings" event, which is the next step in handling the regression case.


In parallel, the "Entrepreneurship VN" event is triggered by the "Report Regression," which leads to a debt collection agency for further action. This agency is part of the regressive challenge's outcomes, indicating that the regressive challenge can also result in debt collection activities.


The "Cash receipt of VN" event is another outcome of the regressive challenge, which is directed to the "Process" event, indicating that the cash receipt is processed as part of the regressive challenge's workflow.


In summary, the "Report Regression" event triggers a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, leading to various outcomes such as case studies, payment requests, debt collection, and processing of cash receipts, all of which are part of the regressive challenge's decision-making process.
