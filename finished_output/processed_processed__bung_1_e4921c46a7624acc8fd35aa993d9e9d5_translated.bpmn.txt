 Upon receiving an order intake, the process begins with the 'Order intake' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to determine if a special shipment is required. If so, the process flows to 'Fill the package paper' to prepare the package. Concurrently, 'Select a spediteuer' is initiated to handle the special shipment. Once the spediteuer is selected, the process moves to 'Order Spediteuer' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway2' to check if insurance is necessary. If insurance is required, 'Complete insurance' is executed.

Parallel to the above, 'ParallelGateway4' handles the regular shipment process. It leads to 'Pick up offers' to gather offers for the shipment. If a special shipment is not required, the process continues to 'Select a spediteuer' and then to 'Order Spediteuer'. After selecting the spediteuer, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2' to check for insurance necessity. If insurance is needed, 'Complete insurance' is executed.

Once the spediteuer is selected and insurance is confirmed, the process proceeds to 'Fill the package paper' and 'ParallelGateway5' to package the goods. Finally, the 'Shipment of goods' event is triggered, marking the completion of the shipment process.
