 When a scoring request is initiated to Schufa, it triggers the 'StartEvent0' and the process flows through the 'Schufa result available?' gateway, which then directs the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway handles the scoring process, which is divided into two levels. The first level, 'Scoring Level 1', receives the result and sends it to the 'Finished result?' gateway, which then returns the result. Simultaneously, 'ExclusiveGateway1' also sends a'receive delayed result' to 'EndEvent0'. The second level, 'Scoring Level 2', receives the result from 'Scoring Level 1' and sends it to 'EndEvent2'.
