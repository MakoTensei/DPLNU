3. **Judgment 2**: This court deals with cases that require a more specific outcome. It sends the case to ExclusiveGateway1.

4. **ExclusiveGateway0**: This gateway receives hunger signals and routes them to Judgment 1 and Judgment 2. It also sends signals to ExclusiveGateway1.

7. **StartEvent2**: When a guest places an order, the event is triggered, and the case is sent to Pieper (the vibrating pieper device) for output.

8. **Pieper**: This device vibrates to indicate that an order has been placed. It sends the output to EndEvent1.

9. **EndEvent1**: This event signifies the completion of the pieper's task. It receives the signal from Pieper and has no outgoing connections.

10. **EndEvent2**: This event marks the end of a specific intermediate catch event. It receives the signal from ExclusiveGateway2 and has no outgoing connections.
