 When the event 'Regression possible' occurs, it triggers the 'Creating a Scent & Time' task, which is connected to the 'Regressive challenge?' gateway. If the 'Regressive challenge?' gateway determines that a regression is possible, it will route the task to 'Creating a Scent & Time'. Conversely, if the 'Regressive challenge?' gateway concludes that no regression is possible, it will direct the task to 'no regression possible'.

Simultaneously, the 'EventBasedGateway3' event can also lead to the 'Regress successful' task if it receives the 'Regression possible' event. This task is connected to the 'Regressive challenge?' gateway, which will route it to 'Regress successful' if a regression is deemed possible.

On the other hand, if the 'EventBasedGateway3' event receives the 'References' event, it will route the 'Regress not successful' task, which is connected to the 'References' task.

Lastly, the 'Date of expiry' event will trigger the 'Incaso service provider\nMission' task, which is connected to the 'Date of expiry' event.

In summary, the 'Regression possible' event can lead to either the 'Creating a Scent & Time' or 'Regress successful' tasks, depending on the decision made by the 'Regressive challenge?' gateway. The 'EventBasedGateway3' event can also result in the 'Regress not successful' task if it receives the 'References' event. The 'Date of expiry' event will always lead to the 'Incaso service provider\nMission' task.
