 In the process of handling a potential regression against VN, the system initiates with the 'possible regression against VN' start event. This triggers the 'Check regression' task, which is designed to assess any issues that may have arisen. Concurrently, the 'Send payment request to VN' task is activated, preparing to address the situation by requesting payment.

As the 'Check regression' task identifies a possible regression, it connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to determine the next steps. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then routes the task to the 'Booking of payment receipt' task, which logs the incoming payment. Following this, the 'Close the process' task is initiated, which is linked to the 'Incoming payment' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Send payment request to VN' task also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and subsequently to the 'Close the process' task. This ensures that the payment request is processed and the process is concluded.

If the 'Check regression' task identifies a possible regression against VN, it also connects to the 'Proceedings' task, which is linked to the 'justified' task. The 'justified' task, in turn, connects to the 'Close the process' task, ensuring that the process is properly concluded.

Additionally, the 'Notification' task, which is triggered by the 'possible regression against VN' start event, connects to the 'Share on debt collection' task, allowing the team to share relevant information with the debt collection team.

In summary, the system handles a potential regression against VN by initiating a series of tasks and gateways that work together to assess the issue, request payment, and conclude the process while ensuring proper communication with the debt collection team.
