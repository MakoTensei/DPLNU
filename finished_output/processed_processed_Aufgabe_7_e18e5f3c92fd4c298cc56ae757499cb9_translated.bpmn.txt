 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\ndemand' event, which triggers the 'Start Schufascoring Process' gateway. This gateway initiates the scoring process, resulting in the 'Result Level 1' gateway. The 'Result Level 1' gateway then sends the 'Result Level 1' to the 'Result\nRight?' gateway, which confirms the accuracy of the initial scoring.

Once the 'Result\nRight?' gateway confirms the accuracy, the 'Level 1 Scoring' gateway is triggered, which completes the scoring process and sends the 'Result\nRight?' back to the 'Result\nRight?' gateway.

The 'Result\nRight?' gateway then sends the 'Result\nRight?' to the 'Level 2 Report result' gateway, which triggers the 'Level 2 Report result' gateway. This gateway completes the scoring process and sends the 'Schufascoring\ncompleted' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway then sends the 'Schufascoring\ncompleted' event to the 'Report delay information' gateway, which triggers the 'Report delay information' gateway. This gateway reports any delays in the scoring process.

If there are no delays, the 'Schufascoring\ncompleted' event is sent to the 'Schufascoring\ncompleted' gateway, which completes the entire scoring process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Schufascoring\ndemand' event, which triggers the 'Start Schufascoring Process' gateway. The scoring process is completed through a series of gateways and events, with the final outcome being the 'Schufascoring\ncompleted' event.
