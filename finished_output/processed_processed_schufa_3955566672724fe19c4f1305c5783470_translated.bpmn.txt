 In the scoring process, the workflow begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'Send scoring request' task with the ID'sid-92BE968B-CC6A-430F-B6C3-21F7A15BC910'. This task sends a request to initiate the scoring process and has 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' as its outgoing event.

Upon receiving the 'StartEvent1', the 'StartEvent1' task triggers the 'Send scoring request' task and also sends 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' to the 'ParallelGateway2'.

The 'StartEvent2' event triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task with the ID'sid-E0470B45-9C9D-429D-A892-1B5A7C42F8B0'. This task initiates the first level of scoring and sends a 'Delay?' event to the 'Delay?' gateway with the ID'sid-DB1F165C-4081-4708-9D90-8CC83273C115'.

The 'Delay?' gateway, upon receiving the 'Delay?' event, sends'sid-837847E7-4E27-4E1B-85E1-3F1A7637C401' and'sid-44E632F5-A27A-4FCA-AD21-F8E47782A5AF' to the 'Scoring' task with the ID'sid-C86346E5-8D15-4BB6-BFF3-7DDB71956634'.
