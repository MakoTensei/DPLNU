 The shipment process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'Lot?' gateway. This gateway has two outgoing paths: 'normal mail order\nPreparation' and 'Select the Spediteur'.

The 'normal mail order\nPreparation' path leads to the 'ParallelGateway6' gateway, which in turn connects to 'Insurance?' and 'ParallelGateway9'. The 'Select the Spediteur' path leads to 'ParallelGateway8', which connects to 'Packaging' and 'Pickup/ Shipping'.

The 'Insurance?' path from 'ParallelGateway6' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway5', which has an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ParallelGateway8' gateway, which is connected to 'Select the Spediteur', has three outgoing paths: 'Pickup/ Shipping', 'ExclusiveGateway2', and 'ParallelGateway9'.

The 'Pickup/ Shipping' path leads to the final event 'Pickup/ Shipping', which has an incoming path from 'ParallelGateway7'.

In summary, the shipment process involves the following sequence of events and gateways:

1. 'Goods are to be shipped' triggers 'Lot?'
2. 'Lot?' leads to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ParallelGateway8'
3. 'ParallelGateway6' connects to 'Insurance?' and 'ParallelGateway9'
4. 'ParallelGateway8' connects to 'Packaging' and 'Pickup/ Shipping'
5. 'Pickup/ Shipping' leads to the final event 'Pickup/ Shipping'

This process ensures that the shipment is properly insured, the goods are packaged, and the pickup is scheduled.
