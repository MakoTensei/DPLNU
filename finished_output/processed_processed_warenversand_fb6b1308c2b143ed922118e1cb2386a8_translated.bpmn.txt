 When an order is pending, the process begins with the 'Order pending' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task accepts the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway3'. From there, the 'Size?' gateway is triggered, which leads to the 'Filling the package note' task. The 'Filling the package note' task then sends the order to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Simultaneously, the 'Pick up offers' task also sends the order to 'Choose the cheapest offer' task. This task evaluates the offers and sends the best one to 'Choose the cheapest offer' gateway. The gateway then sends the chosen offer to 'Order Sepediteur' task.

The 'Order Sepediteur' task accepts the offer and sends the order to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Size?' gateway is triggered again, leading to the 'Filling the package note' task.

After the package is filled, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which checks if insurance is required. If it is, the task sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then sends the order to 'Goods shipped' task.

If insurance is not required, the 'Complete insurance' task sends the order directly to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Goods shipped' task then sends the order to its final destination.

In summary, the process starts with an 'Order pending' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Goods shipped' event. The process involves accepting the order, evaluating offers, filling the package, and shipping the goods.
