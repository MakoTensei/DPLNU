 In the scoring process, a series of tasks and gateways are orchestrated to ensure the seamless flow of information and results between different systems. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. The process begins with an incoming event named "Scoring\nRequired," which triggers the first task, "Send scoring inquiry to SCHUFA." This task initiates the process by sending a request to the SCHUFA system to obtain the necessary scoring information.

2. Once the inquiry is sent, the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway receives the "Scoring\nRequired" event and forwards it to two outgoing tasks: "Scoring request\nfinished" and "Notification\nDelay\nobtained." The former task signifies the completion of the scoring request, while the latter indicates that a delay notification has been obtained.

3. The "Scoring request\nfinished" task triggers the "Level 1 result\nobtained" gateway, which checks if the Level 1 results are available. If available, it sends the results to the "Transfer Level 1 results to Frontend" task, which then transfers the Level 1 results to the frontend system.

4. Concurrently, the "Notification\nDelay\nobtained" task sends a forward delay message to the "forward delay message to Frontend" gateway, indicating that there is a delay in obtaining the results.

5. The "Level 1 result\nobtained" gateway receives the "Scoring\nRequired" event and forwards it to two outgoing tasks: "Scoring request\nfinished" and "Level 2 results\nthe." The former task signifies the completion of the scoring request, while the latter indicates that the Level 2 results are available.

6. The "Scoring request\nfinished" task triggers the "Transfer Level 2 results to Frontend" task, which transfers the Level 2 results to the frontend system.

7. The "Level 2 results\nthe" gateway receives the "Level 1 result\navailable?" event and sends the Level 2 results to the "Scoring request\nfinished" task, indicating the completion
