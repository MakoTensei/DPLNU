This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Separation of dispatch' task. The 'Separation of dispatch' task then connects to 'Shipping way?', which is a gateway that leads to two outcomes: 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Insurance?'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to the 'Packaging of goods' task. The 'Packaging of goods' task is connected to 'Good quality', which is an end event.

Meanwhile, the 'Insurance?' task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway is also connected to the 'clarification of the invoice whether insurance necessary' task, which in turn connects back to 'Shipping way?' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'clarification of the invoice whether insurance necessary' task is also connected to 'Complete insurance', which leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway is connected to 'Good quality', which is an end event.
