 In the shipping process, the first step is to enroll in shipping costs, which triggers the 'Shipping costs\nenroll' event. This event leads to the 'choose the cheapest offer' task, where the system selects the most cost-effective shipping option. Once the offer is chosen, the 'Specialist' task is initiated to handle the order, and the 'ParallelGateway4' task is triggered to take delivery of the goods.

After the goods are received, the 'Postal mail' task is activated to send the package via postal mail. This task requires the 'Request quantity' to be passed through the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway to determine if insurance is needed. If insurance is necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, and the'sid-FFF8CA9D-F392-4BE8-8DE0-C86A97002EAC' task is initiated to finalize the insurance process.

Once the insurance is complete, the 'Packaging goods' task is activated, and the 'ParallelGateway4' task is triggered again to package the goods. After packaging, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is initiated, which requires the 'ParallelGateway5' task to be passed through the 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway to confirm the collection details.

Finally, the 'Preparatory shipping' task is activated, and the 'ParallelGateway5' task is passed through the 'Preparatory shipping' gateway to prepare the package for shipping. The process ends with the 'Preparatory shipping' task, which completes the shipping process.
