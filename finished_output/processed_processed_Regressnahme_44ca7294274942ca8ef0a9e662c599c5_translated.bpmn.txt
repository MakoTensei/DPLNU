 In a financial transaction system, the following processes and gateways interact to manage various events:

When a 'Regression the' event occurs, it triggers the 'Regress authorized?' gateway, which in turn sends a message to the 'Send a message' gateway and closes the process by sending an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Send a message' gateway receives an incoming message from the 'Regress authorized?' gateway and sends a 'Book money receipt' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Debt collection office' process is initiated by the 'EventBasedGateway4' and sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Book money receipt' process receives an incoming message from the 'Incoming payment\n:' gateway and closes the process by sending an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Waiting period Expired' process is triggered by the 'Regress authorized?' gateway and closes the process by sending an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Opposition' process is initiated by the 'EventBasedGateway4' and sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'EndEvent0' process is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway4' and closes the process by sending an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

In summary, the system handles various events and processes, such as regressing authorized, sending messages, debt collection, and booking money receipts, by interacting with different gateways and closing processes with 'EndEvent0' messages.
