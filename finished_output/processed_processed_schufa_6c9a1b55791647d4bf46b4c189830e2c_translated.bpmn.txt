 In the scoring process, there are two main levels of determining scoring: Level 1 and Level 2. The Level 1 process begins when a scoring request is obtained, which triggers the Gateway 'Scoring available?'. This Gateway then sends a response to the requestor, indicating whether scoring is available or not. If scoring is available, the request proceeds to the Level 2 process.

The Level 2 process starts with the Gateway 'EventBasedGateway1', which receives the scoring request and sends it to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1'. This event then sends the scoring request to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which in turn sends the scoring request to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' then sends the scoring request to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'.

Finally, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' sends the scoring request to the 'Scoring\nsent' event, which marks the completion of the scoring process. The 'Scoring\nsent' event can be triggered by either the Level 1 or Level 2 processes, depending on the availability of scoring.
