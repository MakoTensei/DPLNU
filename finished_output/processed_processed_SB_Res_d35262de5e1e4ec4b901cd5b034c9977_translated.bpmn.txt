 Upon visiting a restaurant, a guest is guided to the ordering section where they can choose a dish from the available offerings. Once the guest selects a dish, their order is recorded and sent to the kitchen for preparation. While waiting for their meal, the guest is placed in a queue.

The process begins with the guest arriving at the restaurant, triggering the 'Restaurant' start event. This event initiates the ordering process, leading to the 'Add your order' intermediate event. The guest then selects a dish from the menu, which is captured and sent to the kitchen for preparation.

Simultaneously, the guest is placed in a queue, represented by the 'Guest is in line' event. This event triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1', which in turn leads to the 'Get ready' intermediate event. The 'Get ready' event signifies that the guest is now waiting for their order to be prepared.

As the kitchen prepares the meal, the 'Cash' event is triggered, indicating that the guest is ready to pay. This event is associated with the 'StartEvent1' start event, which also leads to the 'Cash' intermediate event.

Once the meal is prepared, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' event is triggered, which sends the guest's order to the kitchen. This event is associated with the 'StartEvent1' start event and leads to the 'Adjust and transfer Pieper' intermediate event.

After the meal is prepared, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent8' event is triggered, indicating that the guest is ready to receive their food. This event is associated with the 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' event and leads to the 'EndEvent1' event, which signifies the completion of the ordering process.
