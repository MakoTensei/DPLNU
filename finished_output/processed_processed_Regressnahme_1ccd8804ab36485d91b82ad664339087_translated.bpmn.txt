 The process begins with a 'Regression request' event, which triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway. This gateway, upon receiving the request, forwards it to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and also sends a notification to the 'Check the case' task.

The 'Check the case' task, upon receiving the notification, proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the case is justified, it closes the case and sends a notification to the 'Opposition justified?' task.

The 'Opposition justified?' task, upon receiving the notification, proceeds to the 'EventBasedGateway5'. This gateway, after processing the event, closes the case and sends a notification to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway4' task, upon receiving the notification, proceeds to the 'Reimbursement' task. This task, after processing the event, sends a notification to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, upon receiving the notification, proceeds to the 'Book money receipt' task. This task, after processing the event, sends a notification to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Book money receipt' task, upon receiving the notification, proceeds to the 'Close' task. This task, after processing the event, closes the case.

The process ends with the 'Close' task, which sends a notification to the 'EventBasedGateway5'. This gateway, after processing the event, closes the case.
