 In the bustling world of VN's financial operations, a series of tasks and gateways work in harmony to ensure smooth transactions and decision-making processes.

When VN's regression is detected, the system initiates a sequence of events and interactions. The first task, "Response to payment request," is triggered, which checks if a payment method can be sent. This task is linked to the "Payment method can be sent?" gateway, which has two outgoing connections: "End" and "Payment received."

If the payment method can be sent, the system proceeds to the "Book the entrance" task. This task is connected to the "ExclusiveGateway1," which has two outgoing connections: "End" and "ExclusiveGateway3."

However, if the payment method cannot be sent, the system moves to the "Not justified" task. This task is connected to the "ExclusiveGateway3," which has two outgoing connections: "End" and "Close."

In the case of a payment request, the "Acknowledgment of payment request" task is triggered. This task is connected to the "EventBasedGateway4," which has three outgoing connections: "End," "Close," and "Share on debt collection."

The "Check the case" task is also initiated when VN's regression is detected. This task is connected to the "EventBasedGateway4," which has two outgoing connections: "End" and "Payment received."

Lastly, the "End" task concludes the sequence, with two outgoing connections: "Check the case" and "EventBasedGateway4."

Throughout this process, the system ensures that each task and gateway is connected appropriately, allowing for seamless transitions and efficient decision-making.
