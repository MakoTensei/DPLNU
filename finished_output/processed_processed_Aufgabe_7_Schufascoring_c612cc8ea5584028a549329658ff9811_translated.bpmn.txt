 In the scoring process, a request is initiated to Schufa for scoring, which leads to the generation of Results L1. These results are then passed to EventBasedGateway1, which in turn triggers the end of Event0 and the start of Event1.

Event1 continues the process by performing scoring L2, which is dependent on the availability of results. Once the scoring L2 is completed, the results are reported to Final Scoring L2 ahead, which is also triggered by EventBasedGateway1.

Meanwhile, the delay report is generated due to outdated results, and it is sent to the Frontend via Report delay to Frontend. This report is then forwarded to EventBasedGateway1, which ends Event1 and triggers Event0.

Event0, upon receiving the results, signals the end of Results L1 and the start of Scoring L1 ends. This marks the completion of the scoring process for L1.

In summary, the flow of the scoring process involves the following steps:

1. Scoring request to Bank initiates the process.
2. Results L1 are generated and passed to EventBasedGateway1.
3. EventBasedGateway1 ends Event0 and starts Event1.
4. Scoring L2 is performed, and results are reported to Final Scoring L2 ahead.
5. Delay report is generated and sent to the Frontend.
6. EventBasedGateway1 ends Event1 and triggers Event0.
7. Event0 ends Results L1 and starts Scoring L1 ends.

This flow ensures that the scoring process is completed and the results are communicated to the frontend for further processing.
