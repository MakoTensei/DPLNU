 When a customer initiates a purchase, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the '3 offers' task. The customer then seeks clarification on whether they will be using normal shipping or require special shipment. This leads to the 'clarification' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Depending on the customer's response, the process diverges into two paths:

1. If the customer opts for special shipment, the 'Print your package' task is triggered, followed by 'Check insurance' to ensure the package is adequately covered. The 'Check insurance' task then leads to the 'Complete insurance' task, which ultimately results in the 'Package shipped' task.

2. If the customer chooses normal shipping, the 'Print your package' task is initiated, followed by the 'Check insurance' task. However, in this case, the 'Check insurance' task leads directly to the 'Ship' task, which concludes with the 'Package shipped' task.

In both scenarios, the 'Package shipped' task marks the end of the process, with the customer's order successfully delivered.
