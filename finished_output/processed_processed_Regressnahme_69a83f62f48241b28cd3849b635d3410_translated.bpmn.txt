 In the case of a regression report, the process begins with the 'Regression Report' event, which triggers the 'Send Payment Request to VN' task. This task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and subsequently to 'EndEvent1'.

When 'VN contradicts' is received, it is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn leads to 'EndEvent0'.

If 'Money received' is encountered, it triggers the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Set process for resubmission' task is also connected to 'EventBasedGateway4', which can forward the task to 'Debt Collection Service Providers' and 'EndEvent2'.

Lastly, the 'EndEvent0' task is connected to 'Existence Possibility?' gateway, which can lead to 'Set process for resubmission'.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. 'Regression Report' event triggers 'Send Payment Request to VN' task.
2. 'Send Payment Request to VN' task is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and then to 'EndEvent1'.
3. 'VN contradicts' event is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', leading to 'EndEvent0'.
4. 'Money received' event triggers 'Set process for resubmission' task, which is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'EndEvent1'.
5. 'Set process for resubmission' task can also be forwarded to 'Debt Collection Service Providers' and 'EndEvent2' through 'EventBasedGateway4'.
6. 'EndEvent0' task is connected to 'Existence Possibility?' gateway, which can lead to 'Set process for resubmission'.
