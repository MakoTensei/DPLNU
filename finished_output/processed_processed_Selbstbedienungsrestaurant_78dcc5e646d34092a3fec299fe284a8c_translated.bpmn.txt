 A guest enters the restaurant, triggering a series of events:

1. The guest is placed in line, leading to the addition of their order to the cash register system.
2. The guest selects their food, which is then ready for pickup.
3. The guest picks up their food, and the server hands it to them.
4. The order is taken against, and the guest is published, initiating a communication event.
5. The kitchen triggers the Pieper, and the order is set to wait for 5 minutes.
6. The order is sent to Koch, who processes it further.
7. The guest leaves the restaurant, and the event is issued.

The events are connected through various gateways:

- EventBasedGateway0 connects the IntermediateCatchEvent3 and Issued events.
- Guest is in line connects the Guest enters\nRestaurant and Add to Cart events.
- Food is ready connects the Guest enters\nRestaurant and Guest has his food events.
- IntermediateCatchEvent3 connects the Takes order\nagainst and Guest published events.
- 5 minutes waiting connects the Takes order\nagainst and Issued events.

The process starts with the guest entering the restaurant, and ends with the guest receiving their food and the order being issued.
