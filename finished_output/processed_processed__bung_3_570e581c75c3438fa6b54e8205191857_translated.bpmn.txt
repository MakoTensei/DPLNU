 Upon receiving a notification of a possible regression, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, the 'Payment on request' task is triggered, which involves processing a payment request. Once this task is completed, the system proceeds to the 'Check the case' task, which involves examining the case details. If the case requires opposition by VN, the system moves to the 'Opposition by VN' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Payment on request' task also leads to the 'Set to WV' task, which sets the payment status to 'Withdrawal' and marks the task as successful. This task is connected to the 'Regression unsuccessful' and 'Finished' tasks, indicating that the payment process was not successful, and the system has completed its operations.

The 'Check the case' task, upon receiving the 'Opposition by VN' notification, transitions to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task. This task is responsible for handling the case when opposition is raised by VN. If the opposition is unsuccessful, the system marks the task as 'Regression unsuccessful' and 'Finished.'

Meanwhile, the 'Set to WV' task, when triggered, leads to the 'Regression passed' task, which indicates that the system has successfully processed the withdrawal and marked the task as 'Finished.'

In summary, the system handles a possible regression by processing payment requests, checking the case, and addressing any opposition raised by VN. The tasks are interconnected, and the system transitions between them based on incoming notifications and outgoing tasks.
