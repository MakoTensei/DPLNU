 The process begins with the task of determining if the quantity of goods to be shipped is large, which is handled by the 'A lot big?' gateway, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway2'. Once the quantity is clarified, the system proceeds to select one offer and initiate order forwarding, managed by the'select 1 offer and order forwarding' task, which also takes input from 'A lot big?'. Following this, the team must decide whether to insure the shipment, a decision made by the 'to\ninsure?' gateway, which also receives input from 'A lot big?'. After the insurance decision, the 'Closure\nInsurance\nfrom' task is triggered, sending the output to 'ParallelGateway3'. Concurrently, the 'packaging the goods' task prepares the goods for shipment, also sending its output to 'ParallelGateway3'. Once the goods are ready for collection, the'ready for collection' task is executed, with its output directed to 'EndEvent0'. This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures that the shipment process is managed efficiently, from clarifying the quantity, selecting an offer, deciding on insurance, packaging the goods, and finally, readying them for collection.
