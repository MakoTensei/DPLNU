 The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent', which triggers the selection of an offer, leading to the 'Select your offer' task. This task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives a request for a large lot and insurance, which directs the process to 'Filling the package note' and 'InclusiveGateway3'. The 'InclusiveGateway3' then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn sends the goods for collection. The collection process concludes with the 'Product is ready' event, marking the end of the process.
