 When a 'Message triggered' event occurs, it initiates a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and processes. Here's a natural flow description of the event:

1. A 'Message triggered' event starts the process.
2. The event checks if there is a 'Possible?' event incoming. If yes, it proceeds to the 'Possible?' gateway.
3. The 'Possible?' gateway evaluates the incoming 'Possible?' event and sends out 'Report negatively completed' or 'Justified?' outgoing events.
4. If 'Justified?' is received, the event moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ExclusiveGateway3' based on the incoming event.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway2' informs the 'Collection informed' process, while 'ExclusiveGateway3' completes the process with a 'Report positively completed' event.
6. If 'Report negatively completed' is received, the process moves to the 'Send VN payment request' task.
7. The 'Send VN payment request' task sets a process for resubmission and sends out 'Money received' event.
8. The 'Money received' event triggers the 'Book the entrance' task.
9. The 'Book the entrance' task sends out 'ExclusiveGateway3' event.
10. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' completes the process with a 'Report positively completed' event.
11. If the 'Message triggered' event is due to a 'Reimbursement period expired' event, it informs the 'Collection informed' process.

This flow ensures that the 'Message triggered' event is handled efficiently, with each task and gateway contributing to the overall process.
