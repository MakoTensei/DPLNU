 When a regression is submitted, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to ensure the process is handled correctly. The first task, identified by'sid-310CBEF8-6939-4594-A760-C559BAD000C0', is to 'Send a message' to notify the relevant parties. This message is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is the first step in the process.

Upon receiving the notification,'sid-A84BC667-07DC-4FA7-80A8-148B1E9BDDA8', the 'ExclusiveGateway3' evaluates the situation and determines if the regression is justified. If it is, the process is forwarded to 'Process forwarded' through 'EventBasedGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the regression is not justified, the system proceeds to 'Set process on WV' by sending a message to'sid-0CA37FE0-F50A-45B4-B298-F38D1D8CC694', which triggers the 'WV-Frist expired' event. This event is then forwarded to 'EventBasedGateway4', which in turn sends a message to'sid-5D91615D-1C81-4BDB-B943-995448169C8D' to transfer the process to debt collection.

In the case of a justified regression, the process is completed by sending a notification to'sid-AF2AF660-5B7B-4C9E-A797-F4FCD09A8CA1', which triggers the 'Process completed' event. The process is then forwarded to'sid-0CA37FE0-F50A-45B4-B298-F38D1D8CC694' to handle the WV-Frist expired event.

In summary, the system handles a regression submission by sending a message, evaluating the just
