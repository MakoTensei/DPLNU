 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph:

1. When a customer feels hunger, they trigger the event "Hunger felt." This event leads to the customer adding their order to the system.

2. Once the order is received, the system enables Pieper, a key component in the food preparation process.

3. The customer's order is then cooked, and the system informs the employees about the completion of the cooking order.

4. After the cooking order is completed, the food is delivered to the customer.

5. Finally, the customer's meal is retrieved, and they are served the food.

This flow of events ensures that the customer's hunger is addressed by enabling Pieper, cooking the order, informing employees, delivering the food, and ultimately serving the meal to the customer.
