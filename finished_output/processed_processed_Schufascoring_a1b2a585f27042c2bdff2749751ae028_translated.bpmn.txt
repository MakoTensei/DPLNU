 In the bustling world of sales and scoring, a series of tasks and gateways work in harmony to ensure a smooth process. Let's dive into the flow of events:

1. The journey begins with a "Schufascoring request" that has been discussed. This triggers the "Trigger scoring request" task, which then forwards the result to the "forwarding Result to sales" gateway.

2. The "Scoring request Report" is received by the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway, which sends a "Delay" message to the "Message Delay we have discussed" gateway. This message is then forwarded to the "Information about delay to sales" gateway.

3. The "Results Level 2 Report" is received by the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway, which sends the result to the "EndEvent1" gateway.

4. The "Implementation first scoring" task, upon receiving the "Scoring request Report," sends the obtained "Scoring result obtained Level 1" to the "EndEvent2" gateway.

5. The "Scoring request Report" is received by the "EventBasedGateway0" gateway, which sends the "EndEvent0" result to the "forwarding Result to sales" gateway.

6. The "Scoring request Report" is received by the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway, which sends the obtained "Scoring result obtained Level 2" to the "EndEvent3" gateway.

7. The "Schufascoring request" task, after being discussed, forwards the result to the "forwarding Result to sales" gateway.

8. The "Scoring request Report" is received by the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway, which sends the result to the "Result Ship" gateway.

9. The "Scoring result obtained Level 1" task, upon receiving the "Implementation first scoring" request, sends the result to the "EndEvent2" gateway.

10. The "Scoring result obtained Level 2" task, upon receiving the "Scoring request Report," sends the result to the "EndEvent3" gateway.
