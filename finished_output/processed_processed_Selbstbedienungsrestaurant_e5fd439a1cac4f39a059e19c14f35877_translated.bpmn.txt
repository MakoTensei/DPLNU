 A person feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant. They select a court and wait until their turn. Once it's their turn, they add their order to the system. After placing their order, they proceed to the payment stage, where they pay for their meal.

Upon receiving the payment, the restaurant prepares the food. The kitchen staff ensures that the food is ready and promptly notifies the front-of-house staff. The staff then picks up the prepared food and serves it to the person.

The person enjoys their meal and, after a short period, they are ready to leave. The restaurant staff checks if the person is within 5 minutes of finishing their meal. If they are, the staff retrieves the guest and prepares to leave. If not, the staff continues to wait for the guest to finish their meal.

Meanwhile, the restaurant staff also prepares the meal by putting it into the reach, which is the area where the food is served. They inform the employees about the prepared meal.

In summary, the person's journey from feeling hungry to enjoying their meal involves selecting a court, adding their order, paying for the meal, receiving the prepared food, and finally, being served by the restaurant staff.
