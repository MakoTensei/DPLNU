 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with determining if a special shipment is necessary, which is handled by the 'Is a special shipment necessary?' gateway. If the answer is yes, the 'Ask and commission forwarding requests' task is triggered, and if no, the 'Insurance close' task is initiated. The 'Ask and commission forwarding requests' task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, the 'Insurance close' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' as well.


Once the goods are confirmed to be shipped, the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway receives the incoming task and forwards it to both 'ParallelGateway5' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'ParallelGateway5' gateway is responsible for creating a package ticket and packaging the goods, while 'EndEvent0' signifies the completion of the process.


In summary, the workflow for shipping goods involves a series of gateways and tasks that ensure the necessary steps are taken, such as determining the need for special shipment, commissioning forwarding requests, closing insurance, creating a package ticket, and packaging the goods, before reaching the final event that signifies the completion of the process.
