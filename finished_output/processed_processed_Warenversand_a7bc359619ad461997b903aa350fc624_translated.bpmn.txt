 In the shipping process, there are several tasks and gateways involved. The process starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers 'Task10' and 'processing large quantities'. 'Processing large quantities' then goes through 'Lot?', which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. From there, 'Goods for shipping' and'small amount' are directed to 'ParallelGateway6', which leads to 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, 'Packaging goods' also goes through 'ParallelGateway6' and ends at 'EndEvent0'.

'Offer 1' and 'Offer 2' are enrolled through 'ParallelGateway3', which connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. 'Offer 3' also goes through 'ParallelGateway3' and connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. 'Insurance close' and 'Insurance necessary?' are triggered by 'Lot?', which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. 'Insurance close' is then directed to 'EndEvent0', while 'Insurance necessary?' connects to 'ParallelGateway6'.

'Order' is processed through 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to 'EndEvent1'. 'Packed goods ready for collection' and 'Task10' are directed to 'EndEvent0' through 'ParallelGateway6'. 'Filling standard package voucher' and'small amount' are processed through 'ParallelGateway6', leading to 'EndEvent0'. 'Goods for shipping' is processed through 'ParallelGateway5', which connects to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the shipping process involves various tasks and gateways, with 'StartEvent0' and 'EndEvent0' marking the beginning and end of the process. 'ParallelGateway6' is a crucial gateway that connects multiple tasks and outcomes, while 'ExclusiveGateway1' serves as a decision point for 'Insurance close' and 'Insurance necessary?'.
