 In the logistics process, a series of events and interactions occur between different gateways and tasks to ensure the successful delivery of goods. The process begins when goods are dispatched, triggering the event 'Goods dispatched they are'. This event initiates the task 'Holt three different offers from forwarders' (ID: sid-F28F91E4-C81B-4FA4-9EAC-ECFECCA51E13), which aims to secure the best quotes from forwarders for a large amount of goods.

Once the task 'Holt three different offers from forwarders' is completed, the next step is to 'Choose a quote' (ID: sid-4D35289E-D812-446D-B31C-1C6D9D681817). This task is dependent on the 'large amount?' incoming event, which signifies the need for a substantial shipment. The chosen forwarder is then 'Dedicated' (ID: sid-51598DAD-F262-4CC5-B642-1D311902D714), and the selected forwarder is designated as 'ExclusiveGateway3' (ID: sid-BBA6A6CA-ABC5-4FD3-BE2E-91C36481BD76).

Simultaneously, the task 'Fill standard package tickets' (ID: sid-C03F1086-CE87-4028-8A93-353F3CB4F844) is initiated, which requires checking insurance requirements. This task is triggered by the 'large amount?' incoming event and results in the forwarder 'ExclusiveGateway3' (ID: sid-C03F1086-CE87-4028-8A93-353F3CB4F844).
