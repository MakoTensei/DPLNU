 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Start scoring request' task, which then sends a 'Display delay message' to the 'Display delay message' task. This task, in turn, sends an 'EndEvent0' to signal the completion of the delay.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Two. perform scoring' task, which sends a 'StartEvent2' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends a 'Scoring result\nsent' to the 'Scoring result\nsent' task, indicating the completion of the scoring process.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent2' task triggers the '1. perform scoring' task, which sends a 'StartEvent2' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends a 'Scoring result\nsent' to the 'Scoring result\nsent' task, completing the scoring process for the second scoring task.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Start scoring request' task and sends a 'Display delay message' to the 'Display delay message' task. The 'Display delay message' task then sends an 'EndEvent0' to signal the completion of the delay. Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Two. perform scoring' task, which sends a 'StartEvent2' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends a 'Scoring result\nsent' to the 'Scoring result\nsent' task, completing the scoring process for the first scoring task.

The 'StartEvent2' task also triggers the '1. perform scoring' task, which sends a 'StartEvent2' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends a 'Scoring result\nsent' to the 'Scoring result\nsent' task, completing the scoring process for the second scoring task.
