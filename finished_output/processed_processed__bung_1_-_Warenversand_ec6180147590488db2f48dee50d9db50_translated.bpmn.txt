 A shipment arrives at the start event, triggering the 'fill out standard package tickets' task. This task checks if a special shipment is necessary and, if not, proceeds to offer the cheapest option among 'ParallelGateway3', 'ParallelGateway4', and 'ParallelGateway4' to the 'ParallelGateway3'. The chosen offer is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

If a special shipment is required, the 'ParallelGateway3' task is initiated, which offers the same three options to the 'ParallelGateway3'. The chosen offer is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Pick up a signature' task is triggered by the 'Is insurance necessary?' inquiry, which also sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Provide goods for collection' task is initiated by 'ParallelGateway6', which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Packaging goods' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway5', which sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' event is triggered, which receives the outgoing messages from 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway6', marking the completion of the process.
