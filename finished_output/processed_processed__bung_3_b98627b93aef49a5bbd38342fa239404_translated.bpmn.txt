 Let's start with the 'Regress examination Report' event and follow the flow of tasks and gateways to reach the 'Process completed' event.

1. The 'Regress examination Report' event is triggered.
2. The event is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway3' as it has incoming connections from 'Regress examination Report'.
3. 'ExclusiveGateway3' checks if the VN is regressive by consulting the'regressive?' gateways.
4. If the VN is regressive, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Process completed' is delivered.
5. If the VN is not regressive, the process moves to 'EventBasedGateway4' and 'Opposition Right?' is checked.
6. If the opposition is right, the process moves to 'Close the process' and 'Process completed' is delivered.
7. If the opposition is not right, the process moves to 'Tax payable on:\nDebt collection office' and 'Process delivered' is delivered.
8. If the VN has reproach, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Process completed' is delivered.
9. If the VN does not have reproach, the process moves to 'Money is\nReport' and 'ExclusiveGateway1' is reached.
10. If the VN is regressive, the process moves to 'Money is\nReport' and 'ExclusiveGateway1' is reached.
11. If the VN has reproach, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Process completed' is delivered.

In summary, the 'Regress examination Report' event triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Process completed' event. The flow depends on whether the VN is regressive, if the opposition is right, and if the VN has reproach.
