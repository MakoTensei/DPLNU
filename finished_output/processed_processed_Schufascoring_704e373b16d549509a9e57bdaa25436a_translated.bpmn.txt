 In a scoring system, a series of events and gateways work together to process and forward scoring results. The process begins when a scoring question is started, triggering the following sequence of events and interactions:

1. When a scoring question is started, two events are triggered:
   - 'Scoring\nQuestion\nstarted'
   - 'forward scoring result'

2. The 'Scoring\nQuestion\nstarted' event can be routed to either the 'Delay?' gateway or the 'EventBasedGateway1'. If it goes to the 'Delay?' gateway, it will send a 'Delay?' message, which can be answered by the 'Scoring result\nobtained' event. This event will then forward the 'Scoring\nFinished' message to the 'Scoring\nFinished' event.

3. If the 'Scoring\nQuestion\nstarted' event is routed to the 'EventBasedGateway1', it will forward the event to the 'Scoring\ncompleted' event.

4. The 'Scoring result\nobtained' event, which is a response to the 'Delay?' message, will forward the 'Scoring\nFinished' message to the 'Scoring\nFinished' event.

5. The 'Scoring\ncompleted' event, which can be triggered by either the 'EventBasedGateway1' or the 'Scoring\n(level 2)' event, will forward the 'Scoring\ncompleted' message to the 'Scoring\ncompleted' event.

6. The 'Scoring\n(level 2)' event, which is triggered when the 'Scoring\nQuestion\nstarted' event is routed to the 'EventBasedGateway1', will forward the 'Scoring\ncompleted' message to the 'Scoring\ncompleted' event.

7. Finally, the 'Scoring\nFinished' event can be triggered by either the 'Delay?' gateway or the 'EventBasedGateway1'. If it is triggered by the 'Delay?' gateway, it will send a 'Scoring\
