 The process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers the selection of a special offer. This leads to the 'Special offer\nSelect' event, which in turn initiates the process of obtaining offers from forwarders. The obtained offers are then passed to the 'Offers\nobtained' event, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods for shipping' event also triggers the packaging of goods, which is handled by the 'Packaging goods' event. This event connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which then leads to the 'Pick up offers from forwarders' event.

The 'Insurance\nRequired' event is triggered by the 'Quantity large' event, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This event is responsible for obtaining the insurance required for the shipment.

The 'Insurance\nRequired' event also connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to the 'Goods\nPickup\nready' event. This event signifies that the goods are ready for pickup.

In summary, the process involves obtaining offers from forwarders, selecting a special offer, packaging goods, obtaining insurance, and finally, preparing the goods for pickup.
