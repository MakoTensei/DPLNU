 In the shipping process, the journey of goods begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Select your offer' task. This task is connected to the 'Select your offer' gateway, which then leads to the 'Pick up offers for forwarders' task. The 'Pick up offers for forwarders' task is linked to the 'ParallelGateway4', which subsequently connects to the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Packaging goods' task is then linked to the 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to the 'Provide packaged goods' task.

Once the goods are packaged, the 'Provide packaged goods' task is connected to the 'Insurance necessary' event, which triggers the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then leads to the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event. The 'Goods ready for dispatch' event is connected to the 'Insurance necessary' event, completing the shipping process.

In summary, the shipping process involves the following tasks and gateways:

1. 'Select your offer' task (triggered by 'Goods are to be shipped') connected to 'Select your offer' gateway (incoming: 'Goods are to be shipped', outgoing: 'ExclusiveGateway3').
2. 'Pick up offers for forwarders' task (triggered by 'Select your offer') connected to 'ParallelGateway4' (incoming: 'Select your offer', outgoing: 'Pick up offers for forwarders').
3. 'Packaging goods' task (triggered by 'Pick up offers for forwarders') connected to 'ParallelGateway5' (incoming: 'Pick up offers for forwarders', outgoing: 'Provide packaged goods').
4. 'Provide packaged goods' task (triggered by 'Packaging goods') connected to 'Insurance necessary' event (incoming: 'Provide packaged goods', outgoing: 'Goods ready for dispatch').
5. 'Complete insurance' task (triggered by 'Insurance necessary') connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'
