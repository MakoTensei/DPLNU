 The process begins with the 'Order Obtained' event, which triggers the 'Offers Enroll Supplement Grant' task, utilizing the 'Scope' gateway. This task is responsible for filling out package tickets and enrollment supplement grants. Once completed, the 'Goods Ready for Dispatch' task is initiated, which requires the 'ParallelGateway4' to process the order. The goods are then dispatched through the 'ParallelGateway5', which is connected to the 'Scope' gateway. Concurrently, the 'Insurance Close' task is triggered by the 'Insurance Necessary' event, which also uses the 'Scope' gateway to process the insurance. The 'Goods Ready for Dispatch' task is further connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' through the 'Insurance Necessary' event, ensuring that the goods are dispatched only after the insurance process is completed.
