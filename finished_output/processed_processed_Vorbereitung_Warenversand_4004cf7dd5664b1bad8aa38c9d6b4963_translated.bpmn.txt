 When a customer requests a quote for goods ready for shipping, the process begins with the 'Goods ready for shipping' event. This event triggers the 'ParallelGateway6', which in turn sends requests to 'ParallelGateway7' multiple times. The 'ParallelGateway7' then forwards the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway4' is also activated by 'ParallelGateway6', sending requests to both 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' receives the 'Insurance required?' event and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the request back to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Once the quote is generated, the 'ParallelGateway7' sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which forwards it to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' signifies the completion of the process, and it receives the 'ParallelGateway5' event as its incoming event.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. Customer requests a quote for goods ready for shipping.
2. 'Goods ready for shipping' event triggers 'ParallelGateway6'.
3. 'ParallelGateway6' sends requests to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ParallelGateway5'.
4. 'ParallelGateway4' sends requests to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ParallelGateway5'.
5. 'ParallelGateway5' receives 'Insurance required?' event and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends the request back to 'ParallelGateway5'.
7. 'ParallelGateway7' sends the quote request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
8. 'ExclusiveGateway3' forwards the request to 'EndEvent0'.
9. 'EndEvent0' completes the process and receives 'ParallelGateway5' event as its incoming event.
