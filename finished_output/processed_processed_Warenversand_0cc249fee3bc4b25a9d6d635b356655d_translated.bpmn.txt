 Upon receiving a shipment, the process begins with the 'Filling the package note' task, which requires the 'ParallelGateway3' to initiate the process. Once the package note is filled, the 'Check insurance option' task is triggered, which involves selecting the 'Specialist' from 'Select the Spediteur' and then routing the request to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is executed, also passing through 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


Simultaneously, the 'Check order quantity' task is initiated, which also relies on 'ParallelGateway3' to start the process. This task is followed by the 'Select the Spediteur' task, which sends a request to the 'Specialist' and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


The 'Packaging goods' task is then triggered, which requires 'ParallelGateway3' to begin the process. After packaging, the 'Provision for collection' task is initiated, which sends the request to 'ParallelGateway4' and ultimately leads to the 'End' event.


Throughout this process, the 'big crowd?' task acts as a gatekeeper, receiving inputs from 'ParallelGateway3' and 'Insurance necessary?' and directing them to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway2', respectively. The 'End' event concludes the process, receiving inputs from 'ParallelGateway4' and signaling the completion of the entire workflow.
