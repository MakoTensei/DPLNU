 In the scoring process, a 'Scoring Start request' initiates the process, which requires the 'Scoring\nRequired' event to be triggered. This event then leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent0', which edits the incoming request. The 'Scoring Level 1' event follows, which calculates the score based on the 'Scoring request' event. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Level 2' event, triggered by the 'Prepare information about delay' event, also calculates the score. The 'Scoring result' event is then forwarded, and the 'EndEvent1' event concludes the process. The 'Request edited' event is the final outcome of the 'IntermediateCatchEvent0'.
