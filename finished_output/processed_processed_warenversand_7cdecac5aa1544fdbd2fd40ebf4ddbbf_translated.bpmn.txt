 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped' (sid-B39C6ED8-6AD5-4B20-B738-138AB7301569), which triggers the packaging of goods (sid-sid-3E8BECB0-5A7B-4662-B2C7-69150CAFDCE0) and the provision of collection services (sid-FA3AD480-45EC-46E3-8983-EF2C2AA5315A). The packaged goods are then checked for quantity (sid-2A6CEFDD-7A40-4DCD-8579-0B31BD512F32), and three offers are picked up from various freight forwarders (sid-5B972BD3-5E61-48F3-AA00-7EF071F91F4A).

The offers are then selected (sid-B47A6966-E3B0-42AC-B2EC-A740317D2913), and a specialist is consulted (sid-865181E0-7CAF-49DA-AFBF-BC158624BBD1) to handle the 'Big crowd?' situation (sid-F00A3E72-642F-48A3-8227-ADE2CF3D6EA4). The specialist's advice leads to the filling of the package note (sid-BF8CE44D-C3BC-4BB7-8EC9-E2A2FA6EF9E2), which prompts the need for insurance (sid-004439F1-A1F8-4205-90DC-A8573332BAC1).

Insurance is then confirmed (sid-B6270137-1A52-4D1F-
