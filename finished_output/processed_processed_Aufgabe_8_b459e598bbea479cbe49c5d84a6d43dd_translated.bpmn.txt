 1. Hunger is fixed, prompting the guest to order their menu.
2. The guest places an order, triggering an order report.
3. The order report is received, leading to an event-based gateway that decides the next steps based on the order details.

Start Events:
1. Hunger is fixed, prompting the guest to order their menu.
2. The guest places an order, triggering an order report.
3. The order report is received, leading to an event-based gateway that decides the next steps based on the order details.

End Events:
1. The food is consumed after being served.
2. The food is delivered to the guest.
3. The order is executed after being processed and fulfilled.

Tasks:
1. The guest orders their menu due to their hunger being fixed.
2. The order is reported, and the system processes it through an event-based gateway.
3. The food is consumed after being served.
4. The food is delivered to the guest.
5. The order is executed after being processed and fulfilled.

Gateways:
1. When hunger is fixed, the guest is prompted to order their menu.
2. The order report triggers an event-based gateway that decides the next steps based on the order details.
3. The food is consumed after being served.
4. The food is delivered to the guest.
5. The order is executed after being processed and fulfilled.

Flowchart:
1. Hunger is fixed -> Order your menu
2. Order placed -> Order report
3. Order report -> EventBasedGateway2
4. EventBasedGateway2 -> Food consumed (if order is for food) or Court of Justice (if order is for a court case)
5. Food consumed -> Deliver food
6. Deliver food -> Order executed

In the flowchart, the event-based gateway determines the next steps based on the order details. If the order is for food, the food is consumed and then delivered. If the order is for a court case, the guest is taken to the court of justice. After the order is executed, the process is complete.
