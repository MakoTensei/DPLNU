 In the banking system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent1' which triggers the 'Return scoring to the bank' task. This task is responsible for sending the initial scoring result back to the bank. Once the bank receives the scoring result, the 'EventBasedGateway1' is triggered, which in turn initiates the 'Scoring result obtained' task. This task is responsible for transferring the scoring result to the frontend.

Simultaneously, the 'EventBasedGateway1' also triggers the 'Delay\nNotification\nobtained' task when a delay notification is received. This task then transfers the scoring result obtained to the frontend.

After the frontend receives the scoring result, the 'Transfer scoring result to the frontend' task is triggered, which sends the scoring result to the 'EndEvent1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring result obtained' task also triggers the 'EndEvent1' task, which signifies the completion of the scoring result obtained process.

The 'Scoring result obtained' task also triggers the 'Transfer scoring result to the bank' task, which sends the scoring result to the 'EndEvent2'.

Finally, the 'EventBasedGateway1' triggers the 'EndEvent0' task, which signifies the completion of the scoring result reported back process.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent1' and involves multiple tasks and gateways to transfer the scoring result to the frontend and the bank, while handling delays and notifications along the way.
