 The process begins with the 'Schufa scoring started' event, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway then sends the 'Scoring request' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the 'Scoring request' to the 'perform scoring level 1' task. The 'perform scoring level 1' task then sends the results to the 'Scoring results' task.

Simultaneously, the 'EventBasedGateway1' also sends the 'Schufa scoring started' event to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, which then sends the results to the 'Process' task. The 'Process' task sends the results to the 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' also sends the 'Scoring request' to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task, which then sends the results to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'perform scoring level 1' task also sends the results to the 'Scoring results' task, which in turn sends the results to the 'EndEvent2'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task sends the results to the 'Delay' task, which then sends the results to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task sends the 'Schufa scoring started' event to the 'Delay' task, which then sends the results to the 'EndEvent0'.

Finally, the 'Scoring results' task sends the results to the 'EndEvent1', and the 'EndEvent0' sends the results to the 'EndEvent2'.

In summary, the process involves multiple tasks and gateways working together to handle the 'Schufa scoring started' event, perform scoring, and send the results to the appropriate end events.
