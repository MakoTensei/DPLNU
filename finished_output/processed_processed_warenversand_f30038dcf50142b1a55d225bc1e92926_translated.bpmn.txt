 Starting with the 'Prepare for shipment' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Prepare for shipment' event triggers the 'Pick up offers' task, which in turn connects to the 'Specialist' and 'ParallelGateway9'.

2. The 'Specialist' task, upon receiving the 'Pick up offers' task, leads to the 'Packaging goods' task. This task is linked to 'ParallelGateway9'.

3. Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway9' task, which is connected to both 'Pick up offers' and 'Packaging goods', eventually leads to the'ready for dispatch' event.

4. The 'Which offer meets conditions?' event, which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway8', connects to 'Choose your offer 3', 'ExclusiveGateway5', and 'Select 2'.

5. 'ExclusiveGateway5' is linked to'ready for dispatch', completing the process.

In summary, the process begins with 'Prepare for shipment', leading to 'Pick up offers', which then connects to 'Specialist' and 'Packaging goods'. 'ParallelGateway9' is involved in both tasks, ultimately leading to'ready for dispatch'. Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway8' triggers 'Which offer meets conditions?', which connects to 'Choose your offer 3', 'ExclusiveGateway5', and 'Select 2'. The process concludes with 'ExclusiveGateway5' leading to'ready for dispatch'.
