 In a business process flow, the following tasks, gateways, start events, and end events are interconnected to report depreciation and score at different levels.

The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Schufascoring request' event. This event initiates the 'Scoring - level 1' task, which is assigned the ID'sid-11F7E609-F964-4CC6-B3B0-A9059E342445'. The task receives an incoming message from the 'Scoring?' gateway, which is connected to the 'Results obtained' event with ID'sid-D32289AF-E144-4613-9511-7EFBB9CBFC9C'. The 'Scoring - level 1' task then sends an outgoing message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' with ID'sid-0E16AE1C-8197-49C7-8BE6-2FAD99813F80'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the incoming message from 'Scoring?', and based on the decision, it sends an outgoing message to either 'Scoring - level 2' task with ID'sid-8F815EE4-3106-4D8E-BEEE-BC5EB478E788' or 'Sufascoring' task with ID'sid-83B9686E-8E92-498E-9082-485442986C89'.

The 'Scoring - level 2' task, upon receiving the incoming message, sends an outgoing message to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' with ID'sid-32B0F8F4-1918-40A0-AB6C-2B62F45C7492'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then sends an outgoing message to the 'Scoring completed' event with ID'sid-668
