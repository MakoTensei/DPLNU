 The process begins with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to check the case and is routed through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If the case is found to be justified, it proceeds to 'Process without result'. If not, it goes to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which forwards the case to debt collection.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event also triggers the 'Set process to WV' task, which sets the process to WV and sends a 'Money received' notification. This notification is received by 'EventBasedGateway4', which forwards the case to debt collection.

If the case is justified, it is marked as 'Case successfully completed' and the 'Money received' notification is sent to 'Case successfully completed'. If not, the case is forwarded to debt collection.

In summary, the process involves checking the case, sending a message, setting the process to WV, receiving money, and either completing the case or forwarding it to debt collection based on the justification.
