 When a scoring request is initiated, it triggers a series of events and interactions between different components in the system. The process begins with the 'Scoring request' start event, which sends the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then determines if the scoring is successful and routes the request to either 'EndEvent0' or 'Notify Bank' based on the outcome.

If the scoring is successful, the 'Scoring successful?' start event is triggered, and the request is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Notify Bank'. The 'Notify Bank' event then sends a notification to the bank, and the process concludes with 'EndEvent1'.

In case the scoring is not successful, the request is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' can then route the request to 'Conduct Level1 scoring' or 'Report delay' based on the specific requirements.

Additionally, if the scoring is successful, the request can also be sent to 'Conduct Level1 scoring' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the flow of events and interactions for a scoring request is as follows:

1. 'Scoring request' start event sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
2. 'ExclusiveGateway1' determines if the scoring is successful and routes the request to either 'EndEvent0' or 'Notify Bank'.
3. If the scoring is successful, 'Notify Bank' sends a notification to the bank, and the process concludes with 'EndEvent1'.
4. If the scoring is not successful, the request can be sent to 'Conduct Level1 scoring' or 'Report delay' based on the specific requirements.

This flow ensures that the scoring process is handled efficiently and that the necessary actions are taken based on the outcome of the scoring.
