 In the scoring process, a request for scoring (Schufascoring request) initiates the workflow, leading to the forwarding of the final scoring result to the appropriate team. When an Entrance Anfrrage occurs, it triggers the transfer of scoring results to the next stage.

The workflow begins with the Schufascoring request, which is then forwarded to the team responsible for obtaining the final scoring result. Concurrently, an Entrance Anfrrage prompts the transfer of scoring results to the next step.

If immediate consultation is possible, the workflow diverges to the Immediate consultation possible? gateway, which can either provide a Scoring request and Answer or a Report delay, depending on the specific circumstances.

Upon obtaining the scoring result, the workflow proceeds to the forward final scoring result gateway, which then leads to the question answered event. This event signifies the completion of the scoring process and the final answer to the initial request.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of interconnected events and gateways, ensuring that the scoring request is handled efficiently and accurately, with the final result being communicated to the appropriate parties.
