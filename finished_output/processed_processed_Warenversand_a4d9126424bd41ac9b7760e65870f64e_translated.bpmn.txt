 The process begins with the 'Shipment desired' start event, which triggers the 'Provision for collection' task. This task receives incoming data from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway4'. Following this, the 'Determining the shipping mode' task, also receiving data from 'ParallelGateway5', directs the flow to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Filling the package note' task, also connected to 'ParallelGateway5', sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Next, 'Pick up offers' task, which gets its input from 'ExclusiveGateway0', leads to 'Select your offer' task. This task, in turn, sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Complete insurance' task, which gets its input from 'ExclusiveGateway1', sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Finally, 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then sends its output to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task, in turn, sends its output to 'EndEvent0', marking the end of the process.
