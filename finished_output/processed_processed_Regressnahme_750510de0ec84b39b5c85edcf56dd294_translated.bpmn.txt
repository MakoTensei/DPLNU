 In our workflow, we start with an event called "Regressive thinking," which triggers a series of tasks and interactions with various gateways. Here's how the process unfolds:

1. The "Regressive thinking" event initiates a task to "Send payment request to VN." This task is routed through "ExclusiveGateway0," which has the ability to either close the case or set it for re-preparation.

2. If the case is set for re-preparation, the task proceeds to "Set on Re-Preparation." This event is also connected to "ExclusiveGateway0," which can close the case or send a payment request to VN.

3. Upon receiving the payment request, "Payment received" event is triggered, which then routes the task to "ExclusiveGateway1." This gateway has the authority to close the case.

4. Concurrently, the "Set on Re-Preparation" event also leads to "Transfer to debt collection office" task, which is connected to "EventBasedGateway4." This gateway can close the case or cancel an invoice.

5. If the case is closed, the "Case closed" event is triggered, which has connections to "ExclusiveGateway0" and "Payment deadline."

6. In the case of "Opposition VN," the event leads to a task to "Send a letter to VN," which is routed through "ExclusiveGateway2." This gateway can either send a letter to VN or route the task to "ExclusiveGateway1."

7. The "Send a letter to VN" task can also be triggered by the "EventBasedGateway4" event, which has connections to "ExclusiveGateway2" and "ExclusiveGateway3."

8. "ExclusiveGateway3" can close the case or send a letter to VN.

9. The "Payment deadline" event can also close the case, and it is connected to "ExclusiveGateway0."

In summary, the "Regressive thinking" event sets off a chain of tasks and interactions with various gate
