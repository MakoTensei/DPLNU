 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nrequired' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to dispatch a 'Scoring\ndispatched' message. This event is then followed by the 'Scoring\nrequired' event, which sends a 'Scoring\ndispatched' message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Scoring\nrequired' event also leads to a 'Result\nfound?' event, which in turn dispatches a 'Scoring\ndispatched' message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The process concludes with the 'Scoring\ndispatched' events, which are triggered by 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'Result\nfound?' respectively.
