 In the insurance verification process, the following sequence of tasks and gateways ensures that a case is properly handled when insurance is not reported:

1. The process begins when the 'Insurance Not Reported' event is triggered. This event initiates the task 'Send VN Payment Request' with the goal of addressing the unreported insurance.

2. The 'Send VN Payment Request' task has two outgoing connections: 'Set case on WVL' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Set case on WVL' task is responsible for setting up the case for further processing, while 'ExclusiveGateway3' is a decision-making point that determines the next steps based on the incoming events.

3. The 'Set case on WVL' task has two incoming connections: 'Take VN to Regress?' and 'Money received'. The 'Take VN to Regress?' connection is a gateway that decides whether the case should be regressed, and the 'Money received' connection is triggered when the payment request is successfully processed.

4. The 'Take VN to Regress?' gateway has two outgoing connections: 'Case closed' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If the case is regressed, it is closed. If not, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

5. 'ExclusiveGateway2' has two incoming connections: 'Proceedings' and 'Justified?'. 'Proceedings' is triggered when the case is not regressed, and 'Justified?' is triggered when the case is regressed.

6. 'Proceedings' has two outcoming connections: 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'Case closed'. If the case is not regressed, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which has two outgoing connections: 'Case closed' and 'Case closed'. If the case is regressed, it is closed.

7. 'Justified?' has two outgoing connections: 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'Case closed'. If the case is regressed, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which has two outgoing connections: '
