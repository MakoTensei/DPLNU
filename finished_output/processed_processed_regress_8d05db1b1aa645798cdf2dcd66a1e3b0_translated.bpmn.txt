 The process begins with a 'Regression claim\npossible' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The 'Send payment request to VN' task is initiated, which then leads to the 'Set on re-submission' task upon receiving a 'Regression claim?' event. This task further leads to the 'Payment received' event, which in turn triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression claim\npossible' event also triggers the 'Examination of opposition' task, which leads to the 'Close' task upon receiving an 'Objection of the UN' event.

The 'EventBasedGateway5' event, which can be triggered by the 'Regression claim?', 'Objection of the UN', or 'Reimbursement period expired' events, leads to the 'Book payment' task upon receiving a 'Payment received' event. This task then triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which can be triggered by the 'Examination of opposition', 'Payment received', or 'Reimbursement period expired' events, leads to the 'EndEvent0' task upon receiving an 'EventBasedGateway5' event.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Regression claim\npossible' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, leading to the 'EndEvent0' event.
