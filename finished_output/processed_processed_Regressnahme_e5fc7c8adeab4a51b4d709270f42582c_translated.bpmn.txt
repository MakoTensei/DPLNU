 The process begins with the 'Conduct regression' task, which triggers an incoming event to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then directs the flow to either 'ExclusiveGateway1' or 'ExclusiveGateway3', depending on the outcome of the regression. If the regression is possible, the process continues to 'Book money' task, which has an incoming event from 'Money received'. The 'Book money' task then leads to the 'Process' task, marking the end of the process.

In another scenario, if the 'Conduct regression' task leads to 'EventBasedGateway4', the process can take two different paths. If the event leads to 'Money received', the process continues to 'Book money' task, which in turn leads to the 'Process' task. Alternatively, if the event leads to 'Process of debt collection', the process goes through 'ExclusiveGateway1' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which eventually leads to the 'Process' task.

Lastly, if the 'Conduct regression' task leads to 'Right to object?', the process goes through 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then leads to the 'Complete the process' task.

In summary, the process starts with 'Conduct regression', which can lead to different outcomes based on the events triggered. These outcomes then guide the process through various tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Process' task.
