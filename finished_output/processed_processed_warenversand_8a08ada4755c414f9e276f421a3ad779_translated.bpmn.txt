 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs\nNot applicable' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the incoming task. This gateway then directs the task to 'Filling the package note' and 'Complete insurance' tasks. The 'Filling the package note' task is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2', while 'Complete insurance' is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway4'.

Next, 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends the tasks to 'ParallelGateway3', which is responsible for 'Determination of quantity' and 'Offered by 3 forwardings'. The 'Determination of quantity' task is then routed to 'ParallelGateway4', while 'Offered by 3 forwardings' connects to 'Select your offer'.

The 'Select your offer' task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway2', and 'ParallelGateway4' sends the tasks to 'Order desired freight forwarders' and 'Packaging goods'. The 'Order desired freight forwarders' task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2', while 'Packaging goods' is linked to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Finally, 'ParallelGateway4' sends the tasks to 'Goods\nmade available', which marks the end of the process.
