 Starting with the 'HW order\nthe' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'HW order\nthe' event initiates the process, triggering the 'Standard shipping' task. This task is assigned to 'ParallelGateway5', which receives the incoming event.

2. 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the event to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

3. Once the goods are packaged, 'ParallelGateway6' sends the event to 'Order procedure\ncompleted', marking the end of the process.

In summary, the process begins with the 'HW order\nthe' event, leading to 'Standard shipping' through 'ParallelGateway5', followed by 'Packaging goods' via 'ParallelGateway6', and concludes with 'Order procedure\ncompleted'.
