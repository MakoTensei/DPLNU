 When a regression case is reported, the system initiates a series of tasks and interactions between different components. First, the case is checked by the 'Check the case' task, which then sends the case to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If there's a possibility of opposition, the 'Opposition' task is triggered, which can either lead to 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, the 'Debt collection office' is notified through 'EventBasedGateway4', resulting in the 'Debt collection office issued' task.

If the case proceeds, the 'Proceedings' task is activated, sending the case to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, the 'On Debt collection office' task is triggered, leading to the 'Debt collection office issued' task. The 'Complete the process' task is also initiated, which sends the case to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Upon completion, the 'Case closed' task is executed.

In the case of an incoming payment, the 'Book now' task is triggered, sending the payment to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Complete the process' task is also activated, leading to the 'Case closed' task.

In summary, the system handles a regression case by checking the case, potentially opposing it, notifying the debt collection office, proceeding with the case, and ultimately closing the case. Incoming payments are processed and contribute to the case closure process.
