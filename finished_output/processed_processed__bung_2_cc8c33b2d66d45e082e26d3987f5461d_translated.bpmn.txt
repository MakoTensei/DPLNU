 When a "Regress is reported" event occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. The process begins with sending a message to the team responsible for regress resolution. This message is routed through the "Possibility" gateway, which has two potential outcomes: it can either lead to the end of the procedure or open a new path for further investigation.

If the "Possibility" gateway leads to the end of the procedure, the system will close the process and mark it as completed. However, if the "Possibility" gateway opens a new path, the system will proceed to the "Procedure for resubmission" task. This task involves creating a new procedure for resubmission and sending a message to the team responsible for handling resubmissions.

The "Procedure for resubmission" task is connected to the "Payment received?" gateway. If payment has been received, the system will close the process and mark it as completed. If payment has not been received, the system will continue to the "End of procedure" task, which will close the process and mark it as completed.

If the "Possibility" gateway leads to the "IntermediateCatchEvent4" task, the system will proceed to the "Close the process" task. This task will close the process and mark it as completed.

If the "Possibility" gateway leads to the "EventBasedGateway2" task, the system will proceed to the "Date of expiry" task. This task will open the "Vorgan open" gateway, which will open the Vorgan system and mark the process as completed.

In summary, when a "Regress is reported" event occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. The process involves sending a message, routing through various gateways, and closing the process once the issue has been resolved or further investigation is required.
