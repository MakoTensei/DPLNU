 In the banking process, the scoring service starts, initiating the Level 2 scoring. Once the Level 2 scoring is completed, the scoring service sends the Level 2 score to the frontend. Meanwhile, the Level 1 scoring service also starts, and upon completion, it sends the Level 1 score to the frontend. If there is a delay in the banking process, an information about the delay is communicated. The Level 1 and Level 2 scoring services are connected through an event-based gateway, which determines if Level 2 scoring is possible based on the Level 1 scoring. Once both Level 1 and Level 2 scoring are finished, the system notifies the completion of both scoring levels.
