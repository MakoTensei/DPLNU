 In the process of handling financial transactions, there are several tasks and gateways involved. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. From there, the 'Check regression option' task is initiated, which then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway leads to the 'Representation Time' task, which in turn connects to the 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'justified' task is triggered from the 'EventBasedGateway4', which connects to the 'Complete the process\n' task and the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Book payment receipt\n' task is initiated from the 'IntermediateCatchEvent7' and connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'handed over to Inkasso office' task is triggered from the 'EventBasedGateway4' and connects to the 'EndEvent1'.
