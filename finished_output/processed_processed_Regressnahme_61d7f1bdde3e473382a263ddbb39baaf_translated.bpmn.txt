 When a regression is suspected, the system initiates a series of tasks to investigate and address the issue. First, the 'Check the case' task is triggered, which sends a message to the 'Regression?' gateway to confirm the suspicion. If the gateway validates the suspicion, it forwards the message to 'EndEvent1'. Concurrently, the 'Send a message' task is activated, which also sends a message to 'EndEvent1'.

Simultaneously, the 'Proceedings' task is initiated, which sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to proceed with further investigation. The 'Tax on debt collection' task is also activated, sending a message to 'EventBasedGateway3' to assess the financial implications of the regression.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' receives the message and forwards it to 'EndEvent3' if the regression is confirmed. Additionally, it sends messages to 'Payment received' and 'Expiration period' tasks, which handle the financial and expiration-related aspects of the regression.

In summary, when a regression is suspected, the system triggers a series of tasks and gateways to confirm the suspicion, proceed with further investigation, and assess the financial implications. The tasks and gateways involved are 'Check the case', 'Send a message', 'Proceedings', 'Tax on debt collection', 'Regression?', 'ExclusiveGateway2', 'EventBasedGateway3', 'EndEvent1', 'EndEvent2', 'EndEvent3', 'Payment received', and 'Expiration period'.
