 The process begins with the 'Shipping requirements' event, which triggers the 'Request to Spediteure' task. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' through 'ParallelGateway5'. Once the 'Request to Spediteure' task is completed, it leads to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway7'. The 'Choose the cheapest offer' task then directs to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping requirements' event also leads to the 'Packaging of goods' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Packaging of goods' task then connects to 'ParallelGateway8'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' also connects to the 'Exhibition Package Ticket' task, which in turn connects to 'Determine value'. The 'Determine value' task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to the 'Goods provided for collection' task, which is connected to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process involves the following tasks:

1. 'Shipping requirements' leads to 'Request to Spediteure' and 'Packaging of goods'.
2. 'Request to Spediteure' leads to 'Choose the cheapest offer' and 'Exhibition Package Ticket'.
3. 'Choose the cheapest offer' leads to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.
4. 'Exhibition Package Ticket' leads to 'Determine value' and 'Goods provided for collection'.
5. 'Determine value' leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway3' leads to 'Goods provided for collection'.
7. 'Goods provided for collection' leads to 'EndEvent0'.

The process ensures that the size of the product is determined, the cheapest offer is chosen, the goods are packaged, and the goods are provided for collection, all leading to the final event, 'EndEvent0'.
