 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the order pick-up process, which is then handled by 'ParallelGateway3'. This gateway then forwards the task to 'Pick up offers', which is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Select your offer' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends the offer selection to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Once the offer is selected, 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends the order to 'ParallelGateway4' for filling the package note. The 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2' and sends the package note to 'ExclusiveGateway2' again. If insurance is necessary, 'Insurance\nnecessary?' is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Insurance close' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2' and sends the insurance close request to 'ParallelGateway4'. After the package is filled, 'ParallelGateway4' sends the goods for collection to 'Provide goods for collection', which is managed by 'ParallelGateway4'. Finally, the process ends with 'EndEvent0' receiving the goods for collection from 'ParallelGateway4'.
