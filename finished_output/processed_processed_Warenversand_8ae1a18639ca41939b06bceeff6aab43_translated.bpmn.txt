 When a customer requests 3 special offers, the process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the '1 selection' task. This task then connects to the 'Ordering Spediteur' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'Fill in parcel note for mail delivery' task. The 'Fill in parcel note for mail delivery' task connects to the 'Size?' gateway, which then sends the goods ready for dispatch.

Simultaneously, the '1 selection' task also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, which checks for the necessity of insurance. If insurance is required, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway then sends the goods ready for dispatch.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:

1. Customer requests 3 special offers.
2. 'Goods be sent' event triggers '1 selection' task.
3. '1 selection' task connects to 'Ordering Spediteur' gateway.
4. 'Ordering Spediteur' gateway connects to 'Fill in parcel note for mail delivery' task.

8. 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway checks for insurance necessity and connects to 'Complete insurance' task if required.

This process ensures that the customer's special offers are fulfilled, and the goods are dispatched with the necessary insurance if required.
