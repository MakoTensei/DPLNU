 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is responsible for choosing the cheapest offer for the shipment. Once the offer is selected, the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task sends the 'who takes delivery?' event to the 'who takes delivery?' gateway, which then directs the flow to either 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ParallelGateway4'.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event also triggers the 'Complete insurance' task, which checks if insurance is necessary. If insurance is required, the 'Insurance necessary?' event is sent to the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, which then directs the flow to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If insurance is not necessary, the 'Perform standard shipping' task is initiated, which sends the 'who takes delivery?' event to the 'who takes delivery?' gateway, leading to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In parallel, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event also triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which sends the 'who takes delivery?' event to the 'who takes delivery?' gateway, leading to 'ParallelGateway4'.

After the 'Pick up offers' task, the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task sends the 'who takes delivery?' event to the 'who takes delivery?' gateway, which then directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Complete insurance' task, if necessary, sends the 'who takes delivery?' event to the 'who takes delivery?' gateway, which then directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Finally, the 'Perform standard shipping' task sends the 'who takes delivery?' event to the 'who takes delivery?' gateway, which then directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Once the goods are shipped, the 'Goods shipped' event is triggered, which sends the 'Insurance necessary?' event to the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, leading to the end of the process.
