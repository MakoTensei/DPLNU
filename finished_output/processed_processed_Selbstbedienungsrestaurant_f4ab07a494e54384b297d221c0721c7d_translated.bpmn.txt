 To describe the flow of events in a more natural and coherent way, we can combine the incoming and outgoing events for each gateway and event, as follows:

1. Hunger: No applicable event.
2. Order Record: The order record is obtained, leading to the retrieval of a guest.
3. Order Obtained: The order is obtained, resulting in the preparation of the meal.
4. Meals Made Available: The meal is ready for collection.
5. Court Made Available: The court becomes available, and the meal is ready for collection.
6. 5 Minutes Expired: The 5-minute expiration time for the order record is reached.
7. End: The event ends, and the meal is no longer available.

Gateways:
1. EventBasedGateway0:
   - Incoming: Court becomes available and 5 minutes expired.
   - Outgoing: The event ends.

2. Meal Collection Gateway:
   - Incoming: Meals are made available.
   - Outgoing: The event ends.

This description provides a more coherent flow of events and their corresponding gateways.
