 In the workflow, a 'Request\nReport' initiates the process, triggering 'Answer\nsend' to respond. This response leads to 'Delay\nNot applicable', which in turn results in 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' initiates a separate pathway where 'Delay\nReport' is sent, followed by 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This pathway also concludes with 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, 'Scoring Level1\nExecution' is triggered by 'StartEvent1', leading to 'Scoring Level2\nExecution' upon successful scoring. The latter then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which finally concludes with 'EndEvent1'. Additionally, 'Scoring\nsuccessful?' acts as a gateway, receiving 'StartEvent1' and directing it to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent1'. Lastly, 'EventBasedGateway2' handles 'Request\nReport' and 'Delay\nNot applicable', both leading to 'EndEvent0'.
