 When shipping goods, a specialist is engaged to handle the process. This specialist is responsible for filling the package note and ensuring that the goods are packaged correctly. The goods are then shipped and insured if necessary. The insurance process involves determining if insurance is needed and, if so, completing the necessary paperwork. The goods are then sent to ExclusiveGateway3, where they are processed further. After the goods are filled and packaged, they are sent to ParallelGateway5 for additional processing. Once the goods are ready for collection, they are provided to the customer.


The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the involvement of a specialist. The specialist takes care of the 'Filling the package note' task, which is then followed by the 'Packaging goods' task. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is initiated. The goods are then sent to ExclusiveGateway3, where they are processed and subsequently sent to ParallelGateway5. Finally, the 'Product is provided' event signifies the completion of the process, with the goods being delivered to the customer.


Throughout this process, several gateways are involved, including ExclusiveGateway0, ExclusiveGateway3, ExclusiveGateway4, and ParallelGateway5. These gateways facilitate the flow of tasks and ensure that the goods are handled efficiently and correctly at each stage.
