 In the scoring process, a request is initiated with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Result Level 1' task. This task then leads to the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task, which receives the 'StartEvent1' and produces a 'Scoring - result\nReport'. The 'Scoring - result\nReport' is then sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn triggers the 'Scoring result\nReport' task.

The 'Scoring result\nReport' task is dependent on the successful completion of the 'Scoring successfully' task, which is triggered by the 'StartEvent1'. This task sends the 'Scoring - result\nReport' to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Result Level 1' task is also dependent on the successful completion of the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, which is triggered by the 'StartEvent0'. This task sends the 'Result Level 1' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to 'Result Level 1', which triggers 'Conduct scoring (level 1)'. The 'Scoring - result\nReport' is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, 'StartEvent0' also triggers 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which sends 'Result Level 1' to 'ExclusiveGateway1', leading to 'EndEvent0'.
