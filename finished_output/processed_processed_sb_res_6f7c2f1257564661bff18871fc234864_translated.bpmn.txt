 When he is hungry, the system triggers the event 'when he is hungry' which initiates the process of getting pieper. This event connects to the gateway 'Get Pieper' with the ID'sid-31BE11A4-37DE-4029-934B-7141B2EA4601'. The gateway 'Get Pieper' then sends a message to 'Pieper piepst', which is the next step in the process.

After receiving the order, the system retrieves the guest using the gateway 'Retrieve guest' with the ID'sid-2B4D11E3-913A-4981-A292-B7A0A00FF6B3'. The guest is then informed that the food is ready through the event 'Info Food ready' with the ID'sid-7BD770D2-4AF8-4911-9365-ED0A0F001AB8'. This event connects to the gateway 'EventBasedGateway0' with the ID'sid-2B4D11E3-913A-4981-A292-B7A0A00FF6B3'.

The gateway 'EventBasedGateway0' sends a message to 'Pick up food' with the ID'sid-6E155292-B307-4413-983F-ED80C9B330F2', indicating that the food is ready and the guest can pick it up.

To summarize, the flow of events and gateways is as follows:

1. When he is hungry -> Get Pieper -> Pieper piepst
2. Order to receive -> Retrieve guest -> Info Food ready -> EventBasedGateway0 -> Pick up food
3. 5 min -> EndEvent1
4. Order meets -> Putting meal in vain -> EndEvent2
