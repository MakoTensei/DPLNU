 The process begins with the 'Pick up Schufascoring' event, which triggers the 'Scoring request' event. This request is then directed to the 'Result is fixed?' gateway, which in turn sends the request to the 'First Scoring' task. The 'First Scoring' task, upon completion, sends the results to the 'Second scoring' task. The 'Second scoring' task then sends the results to the 'Scoring Level 1' task. The 'Scoring Level 1' task, after processing, sends the results to the 'Get delay message' gateway. The gateway then sends the results to the 'Scoring Level 2' task, which finally sends the final scoring results to the 'Scoring' event, marking the end of the scoring process.
