 In the banking system, the process begins when the 'Schufascoring' event occurs, which triggers the 'Delay message' gateway to send a message to the 'Delay\nsend' task. This task then sends the 'Scoring result Level 1\nobtained' message to the 'Scoring result Level 1\nReport back' task, which forwards the results to the 'Frontend'. Meanwhile, the 'Result\npresent?' gateway receives the 'Scoring request\nReport' and sends the 'Result\nLevel 1\nReport back' and 'Schufa process\nFinished' tasks. The 'Scoring result Level 1\nobtained' task is also triggered by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and sends the results to the 'forward scorin results to Frontend' task. The 'Scoring result Level 2\nobtained' task, which has no incoming or outgoing tasks, signifies the end of the process.
