 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and conversational way, connecting the tasks and gateways:

1. The process begins with the event "Hunger\nNot applicable," where the guest expresses hunger but no specific order is given. This event triggers the task "Order the Court," which selects a court for the guest.

2. The guest is then informed about the selected court, and they decide to order food. This event leads to the task "Order the Court," which sends an incoming message to the "Customers call" gateway.

3. The "Customers call" gateway receives the incoming message and informs the guest about the order. The guest then decides to order food, which triggers the task "Food\nPay."

4. The task "Food\nPay" sends an incoming message to the "Food" gateway, which takes the order and prepares the meal.

5. Once the meal is prepared, the "Food" gateway sends an incoming message to the "Pieper" gateway, indicating that the meal is ready.

6. The "Pieper" gateway then delivers the meal to the guest, and the event "Famine" is triggered, indicating that the guest is now satisfied.

7. Meanwhile, the "Staff infomating" task processes the order and sends an incoming message to the "EventBasedGateway0."

8. The "EventBasedGateway0" receives the incoming message and informs the guest about the completion of the order. It also triggers the event "About\nCompletion\ninformed," which sends an incoming message to the "Customers coming" gateway.

9. The "Customers coming" gateway receives the incoming message and informs the guest that the order is being prepared.

10. The "Food" gateway prepares the meal and sends an incoming message to the "Delivering meal in abundance" gateway.

11. The "Delivering meal in abundance" gateway delivers the meal to the guest, and the event "Staff infomating" is triggered.

12. The "Staff infomating" task informs the guest about the completion of the order, and the
