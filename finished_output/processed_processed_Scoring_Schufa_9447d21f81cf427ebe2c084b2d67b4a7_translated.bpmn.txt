 In the workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Share delay' task. This task is then followed by the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which has no delay and leads to the 'Scoring result forward' task. The 'Scoring result forward' task is then followed by the 'Report delay' task, which triggers the 'perform scoring level 2' task. This task also has no delay and leads to the 'Scoring result forward' task again. Finally, the 'Scoring result forward' task triggers the 'EndEvent3' and 'EndEvent2' tasks.

The 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which has no delay and leads to the 'Scoring result forward' task. This task then triggers the 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent0' tasks.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' is triggered by the 'forward scoring request' task and leads to the 'EndEvent0' task. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' is triggered by the 'StartEvent0' task and leads to the 'EndEvent1' task.

The 'no delay\n' gateway receives the 'StartEvent1' and 'no delay\n' tasks, and it leads to the 'EndEvent3' and 'EndEvent2' tasks. The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'StartEvent0' and 'EndEvent0' tasks, and it leads to the 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent0' tasks.

In summary, the workflow starts with 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1', which trigger various tasks and gateways, leading to the final 'EndEvent3' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'no delay\n' gateway plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth flow of tasks and events.
