 When a scoring request is obtained, the system initiates a process to determine the scoring level. This process begins with the 'Scoring request obtained' event, which triggers the 'Determining scoring level 1' task. The task is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which is responsible for handling incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate next steps.

Simultaneously, the system also starts the 'Determining scoring level 2' task, which is also directed to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is triggered by the 'Scoring request obtained' event, but it is independent of the first task and can be processed concurrently.

Once the tasks are completed, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the results and sends them to the'sid-C2AD86DF-0815-4A70-90A4-9AA5DACB6882' gateway. This gateway is responsible for further processing and delivering the results to the appropriate destination.

In the meantime, the 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Scoring request obtained' event and the 'Determining scoring level 2' task. It processes these events and sends the results to the 'Delay Report obtained' and 'Scoring result obtained' tasks, respectively. The 'Delay Report obtained' task is directed to'sid-821F47C9-E732-4D1B-8EE7-EE7DAE97F620', while the 'Scoring result obtained' task is directed to'sid-5081B6A7-CD86-4A5E-9B74-AFAE83109C3D'.

Finally, the 'Scoring desired' event triggers the 'Scoring level 1' task, which is directed to'sid-09FB2EC8-9DAE-4740-A167-07D2FC05BA79'. This task is responsible for determining the scoring level based on the desired outcome.

Upon completion of the scoring process, the system generates the 'Schufa scoring carried out' and 'Sch
