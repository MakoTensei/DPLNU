 Upon receiving the 'Goods be sent' event, the process begins with the 'Pick up three offers' task, which requires the 'Type of shipping?' information. This task is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn forwards the 'Type of shipping?' to 'Type of shipping?' gateway, leading to the 'Evaluate offers and commission forwarders' task.

Next, the 'Shipping clarification' task is triggered, requiring the 'Goods be sent' information. This task is directed to 'Insurance?' gateway, which then routes the information to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, also needing the 'Goods be sent' information. It is routed to 'ParallelGateway5', which forwards the information to 'Provide goods for collection'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway receives the 'Type of shipping?' information from 'Pick up three offers' and 'Evaluate offers and commission forwarders' tasks. It then routes the 'Type of shipping?' to 'Packaging goods' and 'Goods made available' tasks.

Finally, the 'Goods made available' task is completed, with the 'ExclusiveGateway3' as its incoming gateway.
