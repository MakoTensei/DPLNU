 In the logistics process, a series of tasks and gateways are interconnected to ensure the smooth handling of goods. The journey begins with the event 'Goods be sent', which triggers the task 'Check quantity' to determine if insurance is necessary. This task connects to 'Insurance necessary?' and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Parallel to this, the event 'Goods be sent' also leads to 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers', which connects to 'large Lot?' and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway is responsible for selecting and ordering freight forwarders, which is another task in the process.

Meanwhile, 'Filling the package note' is another task that is triggered by 'large Lot?' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task ensures that the necessary information is included in the package note.

Once the goods are sent, 'Delivering goods' is triggered, which connects to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then connects to 'Goods made available', marking the end of the logistics process.

In summary, the logistics process involves checking the quantity of goods, determining if insurance is necessary, selecting and ordering freight forwarders, filling the package note, and finally delivering the goods. The process is facilitated by various gateways, including 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'ExclusiveGateway3', and 'ParallelGateway4', which ensure the smooth flow of tasks and events.
