1. The user feels hungry, triggering the 'Hunger' start event.
2. The system retrieves customers to prepare for the order.
3. The user decides to go to a restaurant and selects a court.
4. The system informs the employees about the order.
5. The kitchen prepares the meal.
6. The meal is ready, and the system notifies the customer.
7. The customer receives the meal and enjoys it.
8. After 5 minutes, the system completes the order.
