 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the selection of an offer from the 'Select your offer' task. This task is connected to the 'Check insurance requirements' task, which in turn leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, ensuring that the necessary insurance is in place.

Once the insurance is confirmed, the process moves to the 'Pick up offers from three freight forwarders' task, which connects to the 'Lot?' task. The 'Lot?' task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' connects to the 'Packaging goods' task, which is responsible for packaging the goods. After packaging, the process moves to the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which connects to the 'EndEvent0'. This marks the end of the process.

In summary, the process involves selecting an offer, checking insurance requirements, picking up offers from freight forwarders, packaging the goods, and finally providing the goods for collection.
