 Let's reorganize the given tasks and gateways into a more natural flow description:

1. Start by selecting a court to begin the process.
2. Once you've chosen a court, wait in line until it's your turn.
3. When it's your turn, inform Koch about the order.
4. Koch will then trigger Pieper, and after 5 minutes, retrieve the guest.
5. The guest will be published, and the order procedure will be completed.
6. After the order procedure is completed, the food preparation will begin.
7. Once the food is prepared, it will be ready for pickup.
8. Inform the employees about the completion of the food preparation.
9. The guest will be served with the prepared meal.
