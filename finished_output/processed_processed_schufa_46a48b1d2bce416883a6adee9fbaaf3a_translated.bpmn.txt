 In the scoring process, the following tasks are executed:

1. When a scoring request is obtained, it triggers the following sequence of events:
   - The request is sent to the EventBasedGateway1, which then forwards the request to the ScoringResultsGateway.
   - The ScoringResultsGateway sends a request to the ScoringPerformGateway to perform the scoring.
   - The ScoringPerformGateway sends the obtained scoring results to the ScoringResultsGateway.
   - The ScoringResultsGateway sends the final scoring result to the EventBasedGateway1.

2. If a delay occurs in obtaining the scoring request, the following sequence of events is triggered:
   - The delay is reported to the Level2ScoringPerformGateway.
   - The Level2ScoringPerformGateway sends a request to the ScoringResultsGateway to perform the scoring.
   - The ScoringResultsGateway sends the obtained scoring results to the ScoringResultsGateway.
   - The ScoringResultsGateway sends the final scoring result to the EventBasedGateway1.

3. When the final scoring result is determined, the following sequence of events is triggered:
   - The final scoring result is sent to the ScoringResultsGateway.
   - The ScoringResultsGateway sends the final scoring result to the EventBasedGateway1.

4. The ScoringResultsGateway also handles the following scenarios:
   - When the scoring request is obtained, it sends a request to the ScoringPerformGateway.
   - When the scoring results are obtained, it sends the results to the EventBasedGateway1.
   - When the final scoring result is determined, it sends the result to the EventBasedGateway1.

5. The EventBasedGateway1 handles the following scenarios:
   - When the scoring request is obtained, it forwards the request to the ScoringResultsGateway.
   - When the final scoring result is determined, it forwards the result to the ScoringResultsGateway.

6. The ScoringPerformGateway handles the following scenario:
   -
