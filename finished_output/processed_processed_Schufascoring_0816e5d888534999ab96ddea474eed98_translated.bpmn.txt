 In the scoring process, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event then leads to the 'Report Scoring' task, which is followed by the 'Return Scoring Level2' task. The 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring' task, which is then followed by the 'Return Scoring Level2' task. However, if there is a delay, the 'Report delay' task is triggered. The entire process is managed by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' which directs the incoming 'StartEvent1' to the 'Report Scoring' and 'ParallelGateway2' tasks. The 'ParallelGateway2' then handles the 'perform scoring' and 'Report delay' tasks, and finally, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' catches the 'Start scoring request' and sends it to the 'Report Scoring' task.
