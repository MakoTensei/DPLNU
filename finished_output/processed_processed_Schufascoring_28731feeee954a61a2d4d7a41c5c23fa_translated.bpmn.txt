 In the scoring process, the workflow begins with the 'Schufascoring requested' event, which triggers the 'Scoring request Report' event. This report initiates the 'Scoring determined?' gateway, which in turn sends the 'ParallelGateway2' event to perform scoring level 1. Once the scoring level 1 is completed, the 'Results Level 1 obtained' event is triggered, which waits for the 'wait for scoring level 2' event before proceeding to the 'EndEvent0' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring determined?' gateway also sends the 'EndEvent1' event, which waits for the 'wait for scoring level 2' event before proceeding to the 'EndEvent1' event. The 'ParallelGateway2' event then sends the'scoring result send' event, which triggers the'scoring result send' event, completing the scoring process.
