 The process begins with the "StartEvent0" triggering the "Normal dispatch" task, which initiates the sequence of events leading to the delivery of goods. Here's a flow of the process:

1. "Normal dispatch" task starts and sends a "StartEvent0" to initiate the process.

2. The "Normal dispatch" task then sends "Package tickets" to "ExclusiveGateway0" for ticketing purposes.

3. "ExclusiveGateway0" receives the "Package tickets" and sends them to "ExclusiveGateway2" for further processing.

4. "ExclusiveGateway2" receives the "Package tickets" and sends them to "ExclusiveGateway3" for insurance processing.

5. "ExclusiveGateway3" receives the "Package tickets" and sends them to "ParallelGateway7" for delivery.

6. Concurrently, "ExclusiveGateway0" also receives the "StartEvent0" and sends it to "ParallelGateway4" for parallel processing.

7. "ParallelGateway4" receives the "StartEvent0" and sends it to "Pick up offers" for customers to choose a cheap offer.

8. "Pick up offers" sends the "StartEvent0" to "ParallelGateway6" for customers to select an offer.

9. "ParallelGateway6" receives the "StartEvent0" and sends it to "Check the offer" for verifying the chosen offer.

10. "Check the offer" sends the "StartEvent0" to "Appoint forwarding" for scheduling the delivery.

11. "Appoint forwarding" sends the "StartEvent0" to "ExclusiveGateway3" for finalizing the delivery arrangements.

12. "ExclusiveGateway3" receives the "StartEvent0" and sends it to "EndEvent0" to complete the delivery process.

13. "EndEvent0" receives the "StartEvent0" and completes the delivery process.

In summary, the process starts with "Normal dispatch" and ends with "EndEvent0
