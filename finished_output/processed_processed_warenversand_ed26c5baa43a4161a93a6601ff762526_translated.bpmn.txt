 When goods are to be shipped, the system initiates a process that involves several tasks and gateways to ensure the order is handled efficiently. Here's a natural flow of events:

1. The order is received, and the system checks if insurance is necessary for the shipment.
2. If insurance is deemed necessary, the system routes the request to ExclusiveGateway1.
3. ExclusiveGateway1 then determines if a large amount is involved in the order.
4. If a large amount is involved, the system sends the request to ExclusiveGateway3.
5. ExclusiveGateway3 checks if a large amount is still required.
5. If a large amount is still required, the system sends the request to Specialist.
6. The Specialist processes the request and sends it back to ExclusiveGateway3.
7. ExclusiveGateway3 then routes the request to the InclusiveGateway5 to check for available offers.
8. InclusiveGateway5 checks for offers and sends the request back to ExclusiveGateway3.
9. ExclusiveGateway3 sends the request to Packaging goods to prepare the shipment.
10. Packaging goods sends the request to ParallelGateway7 to handle the packaging process.
11. ParallelGateway7 sends the request to ExclusiveGateway1 to complete the insurance process.
12. Once the insurance is complete, the system sends the goods for shipping.
13. The system checks if the goods have been shipped and sends the request to ParallelGateway6.
14. ParallelGateway6 sends the request to Goods sent to finalize the shipment process.

In summary, the process starts with checking if insurance is necessary for the shipment, followed by a series of gateways and tasks to ensure the order is processed correctly and efficiently. The process ends with the goods being shipped and the system confirming the completion of the shipment.
