 The process begins with the initiation of a scoring request, which triggers the Level 1 exam completion checkpoint. If the exam is completed, the request is directed to ExclusiveGateway1. Upon receiving the initiate request, ExclusiveGateway1 forwards the request to the Level 1 exam completion checkpoint.

Once the Level 1 exam is completed, the system proceeds to start scoring Level 1. The scoring process is initiated by a Schufa request, which triggers the Report delay of the bank checkpoint. The system then moves to start scoring Level 2, which is contingent on the Scoring remediable? checkpoint.

The scoring process for Level 1 results in the sending of Schufa result 1, while the scoring process for Level 2 results in the sending of Schufa result 2. The system concludes by retrieving the Schufa results.
