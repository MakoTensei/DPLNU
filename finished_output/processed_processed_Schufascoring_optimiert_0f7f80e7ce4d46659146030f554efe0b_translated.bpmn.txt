 In the financial investigation process, a series of events and gateways are triggered to score and report on debt-related matters. When a "Sufa required" event occurs, it initiates a "Show delay" gateway, which is connected to the "EventBasedGateway1". This gateway, in turn, processes the "Sufa required" event and sends a "Delay obtained" event, which triggers the "Delay Report" gateway.

Simultaneously, the "Sufa required" event also triggers the "Level 1 scoring Debt" gateway, which sends a "Investigation Mission" event to the "Report the result" gateway. This gateway then sends a "Reported" event, which is connected to the "Schufa determined" gateway.

The "Schufa determined" gateway, upon receiving the "Delay obtained" event, sends a "Schufa determined" event, which is connected to the "Scoring final?" gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends a "Reported" event, which is connected to the "Level 2 scoring Debt" gateway.

The "Level 2 scoring Debt" gateway, upon receiving the "Scoring final?" event, sends a "Scoring final?" event, which is connected to the "Scoring final?" gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends a "Reported" event, which is connected to the "Schufa determined" gateway.

In summary, the process begins with a "Sufa required" event, which triggers a series of events and gateways, ultimately leading to the determination of the debt score and the reporting of the results.
