 In the process of determining partner data, the workflow begins with the 'Start SchufaScoring' event, which triggers the 'Determining partner data' task. This task initiates the 'Start SchufaScoring' process and sets the stage for subsequent tasks.

The 'Start SchufaScoring' process then leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task, which is responsible for requesting the 'Level1 scoring' process. The 'Level1 scoring' process is essential for obtaining the initial results, and it sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' to the 'Are there any results?' gateway.

Upon receiving the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', the 'Are there any results?' gateway triggers the 'Edition Schufa Result' task, which processes the Level1 scoring results. The 'Edition Schufa Result' task then sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to the 'Is the result already fixed?' gateway.

The 'Is the result already fixed?' gateway, in turn, initiates the 'Feedback Result' task, which checks if the results are already fixed. If the results are not fixed, the 'Feedback Result' task sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' back to the 'Edition Schufa Result' task.

If the results are fixed, the 'Feedback Result' task sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' to the 'Start SchufaScore for partners' gateway, which triggers the 'Implementation of scoring for partners' task. This task requests the 'Start SchufaScore for partners' process and sets the stage for the 'Is the result already fixed?' task.

The 'Is the result already fixed?' task, upon receiving the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to the 'Feedback Result' gateway. The 'Feedback Result' gateway then sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' to the 'Score performed' task, which processes the results and sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' back to the 'Is the result already fixed?' task.

If the results are not fixed, the 'Feedback Result' task sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' to the 'Score-led' task, which handles the feedback and sends
