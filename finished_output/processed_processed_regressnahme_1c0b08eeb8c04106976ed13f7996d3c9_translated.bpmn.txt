 The workflow begins with the event 'Possibility of regress' (sid-544DEB34-1286-4FEA-8CD2-ACD743F0EDE8), which has no incoming connections but leads to the 'Close' task (sid-9DC27392-6E1A-48A6-A2B8-D4C190D15414).

Next, the 'Regress possible?' event (sid-2D7F945B-BCF6-449F-8097-17A9F4BD2E76) receives incoming connections from 'Possibility of regress' and directs to the 'Close' task (sid-0B586051-5FB7-4E52-AB04-5CA11EBC6831).

The 'Book the entrance' task (sid-559F11A8-8A37-49F0-95CD-0EBF592E238F) is triggered by the 'Money received' event (sid-6D8A2624-9041-4737-B35D-516E16AF0543) and leads to the 'Entrance' task (sid-63C6E4F2-3F89-4444-A9F2-C7B896937F1A).

The 'Proceedings' event (sid-526809E9-C973-4A61-A9A5-8615B50FF812) is initiated by 'VN contradicts' (sid-69A97BF6-94E6-42EF-8BE6-2F707D921E65) and results in the 'Not justified' task (sid-AE6205C8-7726-4515-8136-EF4D4F5
