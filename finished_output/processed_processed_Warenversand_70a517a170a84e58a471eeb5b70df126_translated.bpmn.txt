 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check quantity' task, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4' and sending output to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is followed by 'fill out standard package tickets', which also receives input from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends output to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Next, 'Check insurance requirements' is initiated, taking input from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sending output to 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is followed by 'Select your offer', which receives input from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends output to 'Specialist'.

The 'Specialist' task then receives input from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends output to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Packaging goods' task follows, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4' and sending output to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Delivering goods' task is then initiated, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway5' and sending output to 'EndEvent0'. Finally, the 'Insurance close' task is triggered, receiving input from 'Insurance?', and sending output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', which receives input from 'Insurance?' and 'ExclusiveGateway3', and has no outgoing connections.
