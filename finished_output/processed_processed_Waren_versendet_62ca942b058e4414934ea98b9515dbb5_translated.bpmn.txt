 In a logistics process, the tasks are interconnected through various gateways and events. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Provide for collection' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn leads to 'Pick up offers'. The 'Pick up offers' task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which connects to 'Select the Spediteur'. The 'Select the Spediteur' task then leads to 'Specialist', which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Provide for collection' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Filling the package note' task, which is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and eventually leads to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Send mail' task, which is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2', connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to 'EndEvent0'.
