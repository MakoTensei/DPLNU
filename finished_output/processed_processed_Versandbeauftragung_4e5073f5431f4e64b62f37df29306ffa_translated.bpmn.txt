 In the insurance process, the shipyard initiates the task by checking the quantity of goods, which is received from the 'Check quantity' gateway. This task is then passed to the 'Lot?' gateway, where the goods are assessed and the necessary information is gathered. The 'Insurance necessary?' task is triggered at this point, asking whether insurance is required for the shipment.

If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Insurance necessary?' task is directed to the 'Insurance' gateway, which then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway processes the insurance details and sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway5'. Concurrently, the 'Packaging goods' task is also directed to 'ParallelGateway5' for packaging the goods.

On the other hand, if insurance is not required, the 'Insurance necessary?' task is directed to the 'Processed' gateway, which finalizes the shipment process. Meanwhile, the 'Pick up offers' task is triggered at the 'Shipyard' gateway, leading to the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to select the best offer for the customer.

In summary, the insurance process involves the shipyard, 'Check quantity' gateway, 'Lot?' gateway, 'Insurance necessary?' task, 'Insurance' gateway, 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'ParallelGateway5', and 'Processed' gateway. The packaging process involves the 'Shipyard' gateway, 'Pick up offers' task, and 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
