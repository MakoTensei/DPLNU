 In the logistics process, the journey of goods begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'who takes delivery' task to determine if a special shipment is necessary. If a special shipment is required, the 'Special delivery' task is initiated, which also checks if insurance is necessary. The 'Special delivery' task then leads to the 'Goods sent' event, either with or without insurance.

Parallel to this, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event also triggers the 'Pick up quotes' task, which evaluates the cheapest offer for shipping. The 'Pick up quotes' task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway4' task, which decides the best offer and sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Meanwhile, the 'Goods are ready for collection' event initiates the 'Post collects goods' task, which also sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Filling the package note' task, which is triggered by the 'Is special shipment necessary?' event, sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway6' as well.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, leading to the 'who takes delivery' task. Depending on the outcome, the goods are either sent directly or through a series of tasks involving special shipments, insurance, and the cheapest shipping offers. The goods are ultimately sent to 'ParallelGateway6' for collection or delivery.
