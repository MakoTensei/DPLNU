 In the given scenario, we have a series of tasks and gateways that are part of a process flow. Here's a natural and understandable flow description using the provided names:

1. The process starts with an event where a report is generated, indicating a possible regression:
   - Event: Report "Regress possible"

2. The report triggers the 'Check regression' task, which is connected to the 'Regression\nRight?' gateway:
   - Task: Check regression
   - Gateway: Regression\nRight?

3. The 'Regression\nRight?' gateway evaluates the report and, if it confirms a regression, it sends the task to 'ParallelGateway4':
   - Gateway: ParallelGateway4

4. 'ParallelGateway4' then sends the task to 'Create/delivery payment request' to initiate the payment process:
   - Task: Create/delivery payment request

5. The 'Create/delivery payment request' task is connected to the 'Reasons\nby VN\nReport' gateway, which checks the reasons provided by the vendor (VN):
   - Gateway: Reasons\nby VN\nReport

6. If the reasons are justifiable, the task proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which leads to the 'Process\nFinished' outcome:
   - Gateway: ExclusiveGateway2
   - Outcome: Process\nFinished

7. If the reasons are not justifiable, the task goes to 'EventBasedGateway3', which sends the task to 'Inkasso contact service provider and drop' to handle the payment:
   - Gateway: EventBasedGateway3
   - Outcome: Inkasso contact service provider and drop

8. The 'Inkasso contact service provider and drop' gateway sends the task to 'Incoming payment\n:' to process the incoming payment:
   - Task: Incoming payment\n:

9. The 'Incoming payment\n:' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which evaluates the payment and sends the task to 'Process\nFinished' if successful:
   - Gateway: Par
