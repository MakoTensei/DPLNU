 When a goods dispatch event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and services. The process begins with the 'Goods dispatch' event, which initiates the 'Complete insurance' task, as the goods are dispatched and require insurance. This task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' with the incoming connection from 'Goods dispatch' and the outgoing connection to 'Complete insurance'.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods dispatch' event also triggers the 'Insurance required' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway3' with the incoming connection from 'Goods dispatch' and the outgoing connection to 'Goods are ready for collection'.

As the goods are being processed, the 'Spedition' task is triggered, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0' with the incoming connection from 'Postal mail' and the outgoing connection to 'Spedition'.

Once the goods have been insured and are ready for collection, the 'Goods are ready for collection' event occurs. This event is connected to 'ParallelGateway3' with the incoming connection from 'Insurance required' and 'Spedition', and the outgoing connection to 'Goods are ready for collection'.

The 'Goods are ready for collection' event can also be triggered by the 'Goods delivered' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway2' with the incoming connection from 'Goods dispatch' and the outgoing connection to 'Goods are ready for collection'.

Finally, the 'Goods are ready for collection' event is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1' with the incoming connection from 'ParallelGateway2', and the outgoing connection to 'Goods are ready for collection'.

In summary, the goods dispatch event initiates a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and services, ultimately leading to the goods being ready for collection. The process involves completing insurance, processing spedition, and managing the flow of goods through different gateways and services.
