 The process begins with the 'Shipment\nMission' event, which triggers the 'Check quantity' task. This task checks the size of the crowd and sends the information to the 'Size of the crowd?' gateway. The gateway then directs the information to either 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

If the crowd size is determined to be necessary for insurance, the 'Complete insurance' task is initiated. This task sends the crowd size information to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn directs the information to 'ParallelGateway5'.

On the other hand, if the crowd size is not necessary for insurance, the 'Check insurance requirements' task is triggered. This task sends the crowd size information to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then directs the information to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Meanwhile, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which sends the crowd size information to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task then sends the information to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Select your offer' task is triggered, which sends the crowd size information to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway directs the information to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Delivering goods' task is initiated, which sends the crowd size information to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then directs the information to the 'Shipping costs\nFinished' event, marking the end of the process.
