 In a complex workflow, the "Test Regression Case" initiates with the "StartEvent0" and proceeds to the "ExclusiveGateway0", which then sends a "Send payment request" to the specified ID. Concurrently, the "Proceedings" process begins with the "Objection of VN" and can either lead to the "Default period expired" or "EndEvent3" based on the "EventBasedGateway2". The "Default period expired" triggers a "Send payment request" to a specific ID, while "EndEvent3" is triggered by the "Incoming payment" process. Meanwhile, the "Justified?" process handles the "Objection of VN" and can result in either "EndEvent2" or "Objection of VN". The "EndEvent0" concludes the workflow, and the "EndEvent1", "EndEvent2", and "EndEvent3" are the final steps in their respective processes.
