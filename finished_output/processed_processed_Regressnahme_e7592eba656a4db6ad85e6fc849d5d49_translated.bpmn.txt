 When a notification of possible regression is received, the system initiates a process to determine if regression is possible. This process involves several steps and interactions between different components:

1. The system receives a notification of possible regression and sends a message to the 'Regress possible?' gateway.
2. The 'Regress possible?' gateway evaluates the notification and decides whether regression is possible. If it is, the system asks if the customer wants to proceed with reimbursement.
3. If the customer agrees to reimbursement, the system sends a message to the'set to reimbursement' gateway.
4. The'set to reimbursement' gateway initiates the reimbursement process, and the system sends a message to the 'Money goes' gateway.
5. The 'Money goes' gateway processes the reimbursement and sends an event to the 'EndEvent1' gateway.
6. If the customer disagrees with the possibility of regression, the system sends a message to the 'Customer contradicts' gateway.
7. The 'Customer contradicts' gateway evaluates the customer's response and decides whether to close the process or forward it to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway.
8. If the process is closed, the system sends a message to the 'Close the process' gateway, and the 'EndEvent1' gateway is triggered.
9. If the process is forwarded to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway, the system sends a message to the 'Proceedings' gateway.
10. The 'Proceedings' gateway evaluates the customer's response and decides whether to proceed with the process or forward it to the 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway.
11. If the process is forwarded to the 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway, the system sends a message to the 'forward to debt collection companies' gateway.

In summary, the system handles a notification of possible regression by evaluating the situation, communicating with various gateways, and ultimately deciding whether to proceed with reimbursement or close the process.
