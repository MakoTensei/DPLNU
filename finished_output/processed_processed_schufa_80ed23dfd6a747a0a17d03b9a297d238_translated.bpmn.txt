 In the system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Schufascoring\nQuestions' task. This task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn directs the flow to the 'Level1 scoring\nperform' task. This task is followed by the 'Level2 scoring\nperform' task, which sends its output to the 'Level2 Treats\nReport' task. The 'Level2 Treats\nReport' task then sends its output to the 'Report results to Frontend' event. Meanwhile, the 'Level1 scoring\nperform' task also sends its output to the 'Delay\nexpected' event. The 'Delay\nexpected' event then leads to the 'EndEvent1' task. The 'EndEvent1' task concludes the process by sending its output to the 'EndEvent2' task.
