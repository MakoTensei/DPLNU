 The process begins with a 'Request obtained' event, which triggers a 'Scoring request' task. This task is followed by a 'Scoring 1 obtained' task, which then leads to a 'Follow-up' task. The 'Follow-up' task results in a 'Request Answer' event.

Simultaneously, a 'Scoring request obtained' event initiates a 'Delay - send info' task. This task is followed by a 'Scoring 2 obtained' task, which then leads to an 'ExclusiveGateway 0' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway 0' task results in a 'Request Answer' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request obtained' event also triggers a 'Level 1 Scoring' task. This task results in a 'Results available?' event, which then leads to an 'ExclusiveGateway 1' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway 1' task results in a 'Request Answer' event.

The 'Results available?' event also triggers a 'perform scoring level 2' task, which then leads to a 'Scoring 2 obtained' task. This task results in an 'ExclusiveGateway 1' task, which in turn results in a 'Request Answer' event.

Finally, the 'Scoring 2 obtained' task also triggers an 'ExclusiveGateway 0' task, which results in a 'Request Answer' event.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Request obtained' event, which triggers a series of tasks and events, ultimately leading to a 'Request Answer' event.
