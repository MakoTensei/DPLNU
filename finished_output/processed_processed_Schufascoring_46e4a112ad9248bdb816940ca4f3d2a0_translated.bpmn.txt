 In the process of scoring requests, the system initiates with the 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to send a 'Send delay' message and also leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Upon receiving the 'Scoring request\nobtained', the 'Report delay' event is triggered, which in turn sends a 'Delay?' message to the 'Delay?' gateways. This message is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which sends a 'Scoring result obtained' message to 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, the 'Delay?' message is also sent to 'EndEvent1'. The 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' event, upon receiving the 'Delay?', sends a 'Delay?' message to 'Delay?', which is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This event also sends an 'ExclusiveGateway3' message to 'EndEvent1'. The 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' event, upon receiving the 'Delay?', sends a 'Delay?' message to 'Delay?', which is then routed to 'EndEvent1'. Finally, the 'Scoring result obtained' event, upon receiving the 'ExclusiveGateway3', sends a 'EndEvent1' message.
