 In the workflow, a 'Scoring request\nReport' initiates the process, triggering a 'Report delay' task. This delay task then sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn processes the 'Schufa request\nReport' and sends a 'Scoring' task. The 'Scoring' task is followed by a 'Level 1 Scoring' task that receives a 'Schufa request\nReport' and sends a 'Result\npresent?' task to the 'Result\npresent?' gateway. The 'Result\npresent?' gateway processes the 'Result\npresent?' task and sends a 'Schufa request processed' task back to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task. The 'Level 1 Scoring' task then sends a 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which receives a 'Result\npresent?' task and sends a 'Schufa request processed' task back to the 'Scoring request\nReport' task, completing the workflow.
