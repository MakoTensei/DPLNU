 A guest enters a restaurant feeling hungry, triggering the process to add their order. They then choose their court, which leads them to be in line. While waiting, they react to Pieper, a dish on the menu.

Once in line, the guest decides to order a meal, specifically Pieper. The order is processed, and the guest is handed a ticket to collect their food. The kitchen staff prepares the meal, and it's ready to be served.

The guest collects their food, and the process concludes with the server retrieving the guest. The guest leaves the restaurant, satisfied with their meal.

In the background, the restaurant's system processes the order, payment, and food preparation. The cashier inputs the order into the cash register system, and the payment is made. The cashier then adjusts the Pieper dish and hands it over to the guest.

The kitchen staff triggers the Pieper, and the guest collects their food. The food is ready, and the guest is prompted to leave the restaurant. The process ends with the server retrieving the guest.

Meanwhile, the restaurant's system also handles intermediate events, such as the guest reacting to Pieper and the food being ready. The system ensures that all necessary steps are taken to provide a seamless dining experience for the guest.
