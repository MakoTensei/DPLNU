 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering a request to Schufa for scoring. This request is then followed by 'perform scoring level 1', which takes 10 seconds to complete. Once 'perform scoring level 1' is finished, 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' is caught, leading to a parallel execution path where 'perform scoring level 2' is initiated. Concurrently, '10 seconds' is also triggered to ensure the scoring level 1 process is completed within the specified time frame. Upon completion of 'perform scoring level 2', 'EndEvent2' is reached. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring results?' gateway receives the 'StartEvent0' and directs the process to'sid-0A2CC0DA-CD53-431A-8431-D3B87C53165F' for reporting the results, and to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Reporting' gateway, upon receiving 'StartEvent0', sends the results to'sid-0A2CC0DA-CD53-431A-8431-D3B87C53165F' and concludes the process with 'EndEvent0'.
