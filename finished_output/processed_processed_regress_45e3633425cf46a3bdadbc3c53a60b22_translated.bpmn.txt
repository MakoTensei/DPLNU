 When the process starts with 'StartEvent0', it triggers a check on the procedure and sends a message to'sid-F2B703DD-5C5B-4B92-9771-D76BFDAFC33A'. If the procedure requires a regression, the process will then proceed to 'Regression?' and close the process, or send a message to'sid-57F7886D-A620-4CE1-B0F2-E67410AE2469'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the process for 'Incoming payment' and 'Turn on debt collection'. If the objection is correct, the process will close the process or turn on debt collection. If the objection is not correct, the process will proceed to 'Proceedings' and close the process.

The 'Incoming payment' event also triggers 'Remarks of VN' and 'Proceedings', which both lead to closing the process. The 'Turn on debt collection' event sends a message to'sid-33611517-1AC3-4F83-BF56-21568AB45B4A' and can also lead to closing the process.

The 'Representation' event sends a message to'sid-2B343BF8-8732-4595-99D6-E12162ABB30B' and can also lead to closing the process.

Finally, the 'Close the process' event can be triggered by 'Regression?', 'Proceedings', and 'Incoming payment' events.
