 In the case of a regression, the system initiates a series of tasks to ensure proper handling and resolution. Firstly, the 'Check the case' task is triggered, which is directly linked to the 'Regression' event. This task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which acts as a specialized pathway for this specific case.

Simultaneously, the 'Send payment request' task is also activated due to the 'Regression' event. This task is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is responsible for processing payment requests.

As the 'Check the case' task progresses, it eventually reaches 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway is responsible for handling incoming payments and initiating the 'Collection commission' task. The 'Collection commission' task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is responsible for processing the commission.

Meanwhile, the 'Send payment request' task reaches 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then routes the task to 'Process completed'. This signifies the successful completion of the payment request.

In parallel, the 'Opposition' task is triggered due to the 'Regression' event. This task is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for handling opposition cases. The 'Opposition' task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which processes the opposition.

As the 'Check the case' task reaches 'ExclusiveGateway3', it triggers the 'Process of which' task. This task is responsible for processing the 'Process completed' event, which signifies the successful completion of the case.

In summary, the 'Regression' event initiates a series of tasks, including 'Check the case', 'Send payment request', and 'Opposition'. These tasks are routed through various exclusive gateways, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the case and payment processing.
