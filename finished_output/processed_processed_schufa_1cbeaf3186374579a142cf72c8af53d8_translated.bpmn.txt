 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'EventBasedGateway2', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'. This event is responsible for forwarding the results to the 'Application' layer, specifically the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Delay Login' process, which subsequently sends the user to the 'EventBasedGateway3'. This gatekeeper then directs the user to the 'EndEvent1', which in turn sends the user to the 'Application' layer, specifically the 'IntermediateCatchEvent6'.

The 'StartEvent2' triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which sends the user to the 'EndEvent2'. This event is responsible for forwarding the results to the 'Frontend' layer, specifically the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.

The 'Scoring request\nthe Schufa' initiates the 'IntermediateCatchEvent6', which sends the user to the 'EndEvent1'. This event is responsible for forwarding the results to the 'Frontend' layer, specifically the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.

The 'Scoring\nRight away?' initiates the '2 scoring' process, which sends the user to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gatekeeper then directs the user to the 'EndEvent2', which in turn sends the user to the 'Frontend' layer, specifically the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.

The 'Customer-Schufascoring query' initiates the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which sends the user to the 'EndEvent0'. This event is responsible for forwarding the results to the 'Application' layer, specifically the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.

The 'Scoring\nRight away?' initiates the '2 scoring' process, which sends the user to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gatekeeper then directs the user to the 'EndEvent2', which in turn sends the user to the 'Frontend' layer, specifically the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.

The 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Delay Login' process, which subsequently sends the user to the
