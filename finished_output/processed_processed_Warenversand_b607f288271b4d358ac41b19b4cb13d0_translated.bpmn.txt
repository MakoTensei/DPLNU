 In the logistics process, several tasks are interconnected through various gateways. The tasks include completing insurance, packaging goods, providing merchandise for collection, picking up offers from forwarders, and filling the package note. These tasks are triggered by specific events and are directed through gateways to ensure a smooth flow of operations.

The process begins with the event 'Goods dispatched they are,' which triggers the task 'Packaging goods.' This task is directed through the gateway 'ParallelGateway3,' and its completion results in the goods being ready for collection.

Next, the task 'Provide merchandise for collection' is initiated, which is triggered by the event 'Special delivery necessary?' and directed through the gateway 'ParallelGateway5.' Upon completion, the goods are ready for collection.

The task 'Pick up offers from forwarders' is triggered by the same event and directed through the gateway 'ParallelGateway5.' This task is then followed by the task 'Order selected freight forwarders,' which is triggered by the event 'Select your offer' and directed through the gateway 'ExclusiveGateway1.'

The task 'Complete insurance' is triggered by the event 'Insurance necessary?' and directed through the gateway 'ParallelGateway3.' Upon completion, the insurance is finalized.

Lastly, the task 'Filling the package note' is triggered by the event 'ParallelGateway4' and directed through the gateway 'ExclusiveGateway1.' This task ensures that the package note is filled and ready for collection.

In summary, the logistics process involves a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, triggered by specific events, to ensure the efficient handling of goods from dispatch to collection.
