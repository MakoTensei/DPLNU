 In the scoring process, a Scoring order initiates the sequence by sending a Scoring order event to the EventBasedGateway2. This event triggers the ExclusiveGateway1, which then directs the Scoring Level 1 to the ExclusiveGateway1. The Scoring Level 1, upon receiving the Scoring request, sends a Scoring result back to the EventBasedGateway2.

Simultaneously, the Scoring order event also triggers the Scoring result back event, which sends the Scoring result back to the Scoring order. This event is then passed to the Information\non\nDelay event, which in turn sends the information to the EndEvent0.

Meanwhile, the Scoring Level 1 event also triggers the Report delay event, which sends the information to the EventBasedGateway2. This event is then passed to the Scoring result back event, which sends the Scoring result back to the Scoring Level 2.

The Scoring Level 2 event receives the Scoring result available? event and sends it to the ExclusiveGateway1. The ExclusiveGateway1 then directs the Scoring Level 2 to the EndEvent1.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of events and gateways that ensure the proper flow of information and scoring results. The Scoring order event initiates the process, while the EndEvent0 and EndEvent1 events mark the completion of the scoring process.
