 In a system designed to handle scoring requests and delays, the following processes are initiated:

1. When the 'StartEvent0' occurs, it triggers the 'Scoring request' process with the ID'sid-sid-09E26CBF-C7BB-4AFC-B038-703AD09C00E9'. This process is responsible for initiating the scoring process and sending a 'Send delay' message with the ID'sid-sid-8FDC5B88-61C2-4AF9-8603-BA921BEC6636' to ensure the scoring process is not rushed.

2. The 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Result\nView Level 2' process with the ID'sid-sid-E9FA7A5A-112A-4CFA-B5B5-9D7EB71B21B9'. This process displays the scoring result for Level 2.

3. The 'StartEvent1' event initiates the 'Level 1\nScoring\nperform' process with the ID'sid-sid-9336A54D-235F-46ED-807A-2AD8245E17C2'. This process performs the scoring for Level 1 and sends a 'Level 1 result okay?' message with the ID'sid-sid-088216BD-933A-43E2-8EC3-9D8BDF31613D' to check if the scoring process was successful.

4. The 'Level 1 result okay?' message triggers the 'Send intermediate message' process with the ID'sid-sid-A867B6D3-9E62-468A-95D9-C8C2042CCADF'. This process sends a message containing the Level 1 scoring result and the instructions for the next level.

5. The 'Send intermediate message' process also triggers the 'Level 2\nScoring\nperform' process with the ID'sid
