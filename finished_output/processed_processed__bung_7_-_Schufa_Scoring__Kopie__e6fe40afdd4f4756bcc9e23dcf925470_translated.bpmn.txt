 In the system, we have a series of tasks and gateways that handle the flow of inquiries and scoring processes. Here's a natural flow description of the system:

1. The process starts with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'forward scoring' task. This task is responsible for initiating the scoring process.

2. The 'forward scoring' task receives the 'inquiries to schufa' input and sends a'scoring 1 result' output. This result is then forwarded to the'scoring 1 result' task.

3. The'scoring 1 result' task, upon receiving the'scoring 1 result' input, sends a 'level 1 scoring' output to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

4. The 'EventBasedGateway2' receives the 'level 1 scoring' input and sends an 'EndEvent2' output, which triggers the 'ergenis return' task.

5. The 'ergenis return' task, upon receiving the 'ergenis return' input, sends a'scoringergenmis is fixed?' output to the'sid-EDCA0831-A58D-414D-952B-F5100B97607C' gateway.

6. The'sid-EDCA0831-A58D-414D-952B-F5100B97607C' gateway, upon receiving the'scoringergenmis is fixed?' input, sends an 'EndEvent2' output and an 'ergenis return' output.

7. The 'ergenis return' output is then received by the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, which triggers the 'EndEvent2' output and sends an 'EndEvent2' output to the'sid-9522C536-3341-40A9-9F82-40C8731A7C51' gateway.

8. The'sid-9522C536-3341-40A9-9F82-40C
