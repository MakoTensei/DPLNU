 Upon receiving a 'possible regress reported' event, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, the 'Check the case' task is triggered, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is designed to investigate the reported regress and determine the appropriate course of action.

Simultaneously, the 'Re-adjust' task is activated, which is linked to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task aims to recalibrate any affected systems or processes to rectify the reported regress.

As the investigation progresses, the 'Book the entrance' task is initiated, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is responsible for securing the necessary resources and permissions to address the reported regress.

Once the investigation and recalibration are complete, the 'Proceedings' task is triggered, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task ensures that the necessary steps are taken to resolve the reported regress and prevent future occurrences.

In parallel, the 'Debt collection' task is activated, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. This task is responsible for collecting any outstanding debts that may have contributed to the reported regress.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' task is triggered, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway7'. This task signifies the completion of the regress resolution process and the restoration of normal operations.

Throughout this process, the system also handles other incoming events, such as 'Notification' and 'EventBasedGateway5', which may trigger additional tasks or actions to ensure a comprehensive resolution of the reported regress.
