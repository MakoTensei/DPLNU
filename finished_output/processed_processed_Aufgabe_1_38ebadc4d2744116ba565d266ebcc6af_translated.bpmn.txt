 In the shipping process, goods are first offered for shipping, with the offer named "Offer 1" and the goods being sent through "ParallelGateway4". This offer is then accepted by "ParallelGateway5", which subsequently sends the goods to "ExclusiveGateway1" for further processing.

Once the goods reach "ExclusiveGateway1", they are directed to "ExclusiveGateway2" for insurance completion. After the insurance is finalized, the goods are then shipped out, with the final destination being "ParallelGateway7".

The goods are first filled with a package note at "ParallelGateway7", and then the shipment is completed at "ExclusiveGateway3". The entire process starts with the shipping of goods and ends with the completion of the shipment.
