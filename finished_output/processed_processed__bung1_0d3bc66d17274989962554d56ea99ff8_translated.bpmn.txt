 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the determination of the shipping mode, leading to the 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the 'Pick up offers' task is initiated, which in turn connects to the 'Select offer Specialist' task via the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Select offer Specialist' task then diverges into two paths: one leading to the 'ParallelGateway5' and the other to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to the 'Filling the package note' task, which requires the 'ExclusiveGateway0' as an input. This task further branches out to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for completing the insurance process.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for delivering the goods. This task is triggered by the 'Yes' event, which originates from the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0', which determines the shipping mode and initiates the 'Pick up offers' task. The 'Pick up offers' task connects to the 'Select offer Specialist' task, which diverges into two paths. The 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway4' and requires the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' completes the insurance process and connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which delivers the goods. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.
