 In the bustling world of case management, a series of tasks unfolds as follows:

First, a request for information is initiated, triggering the 'Get the info' event, which seamlessly connects to ExclusiveGateway2. This gateway then evaluates the incoming data and determines if the case is acceptable based on the provided information.

If the case is deemed acceptable, the process moves forward to 'Make booking & Close the case.' This task requires the payment to be received, which is facilitated by the'money received' event. Upon receiving the payment, the case is closed, and the 'case closed' event is triggered, with ExclusiveGateway0 and ExclusiveGateway0 as incoming connections.

Alternatively, if the insurance company disagrees with the case, the 'insurant disagrees' event is triggered, leading to the closure of the case. This event also connects to ExclusiveGateway0, resulting in the 'case closed' event.

In some instances, the case may need to be forwarded to a collection agency. This occurs when the 'Forward to collection agency' task is triggered, which is connected to the 'Date' event. The 'case sent to coll agency' event is then triggered, marking the end of the case's journey through the system.

Throughout this process, the 'Check the case for the possibility' and 'Check the reasoning if acceptable' tasks are also executed, with ExclusiveGateway2 as their outgoing connection. These tasks ensure that the case is thoroughly evaluated before proceeding to the next step.

In summary, the case management system seamlessly connects various tasks and events, ensuring that each case is handled efficiently and effectively. From gathering information to making bookings, closing cases, and forwarding to collection agencies, the system ensures that every step is taken with precision and care.
