 A guest feeling hungry initiates the process by selecting a court, which leads to them waiting in line. Once they're in line, they proceed to add their order, specifying the amount they demand. The cashier then receives the order report, processes the payment, and prepares the meal.

After the meal is prepared, the guest is notified that the meal is available and can be picked up. Upon picking up the meal, the guest experiences satisfaction, marking the end of the process.

In parallel, the guest's hunger triggers a series of events:

1. The guest selects a court, which prompts them to wait in line.
2. While waiting, the guest adds their order, specifying the amount they demand.
3. The cashier receives the order report, processes the payment, and prepares the meal.
4. The guest is notified that the meal is available and can be picked up.
5. The guest picks up the meal, leading to a satisfying experience.

Additionally, there are gateways that manage the flow of the process:

- When a guest picks up their meal, the system checks if they have waited for 5 minutes. If so, the meal is made available for pickup.
- The amount demanded by the guest triggers the payment process, leading to the preparation of the meal.
- The guest's hunger also triggers the payment process, ensuring the meal is prepared and made available for pickup.

This interconnected system ensures a smooth and efficient process from the guest's hunger to the satisfaction of enjoying their meal.
