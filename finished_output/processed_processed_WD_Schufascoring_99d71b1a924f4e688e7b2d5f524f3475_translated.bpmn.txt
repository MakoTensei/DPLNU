 In the world of data processing, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure a smooth flow of information. Let's dive into the details of these tasks and gateways, starting with the "Start your search" task.

The "Start your search" task, identified by the ID'sid-B0170175-BC28-4E31-BEB6-EC526478AA5D', is the initial step in the process. It has no incoming events but sends a message to the "StartEvent0" gateway, triggering the search process.

Once the search process begins, the "IntermediateCatchEvent3" task comes into play. This task, with the ID'sid-264B0514-7FE9-449F-A764-C20D112E7A89', is responsible for catching intermediate events during the search. It sends a message to the "EndEvent0" gateway and also to the "IntermediateCatchEvent4" gateway.

The "IntermediateCatchEvent4" task, identified by the ID'sid-CC2BCB76-2B57-42DC-8D6A-75AD8BB71EAC', is the next step in the process. It catches intermediate events and sends a message to the "Send delay message" gateway.

The "Send delay message" task, with the ID'sid-D3318C01-AC42-4305-B88E-EDCEEAE1D7A5', is responsible for sending a delay message. It receives a message from the "IntermediateCatchEvent4" gateway and sends a message to the "Results determined?" gateway.

The "Results determined?" gateway, identified by the ID'sid-1C4C1D63-F005-4A65-B4AC-225789902E32', is the next step in the process. It receives a message from the "Send delay message" task and sends messages to the "Create delay delay message" and "EndEvent1" gateways.

The "Create delay message
