 To complete the insurance process for large quantities of goods, the system initiates with the 'Insurance required?' gateway, which receives the 'Large quantities?' input. This triggers the 'ParallelGateway3' to handle the incoming request. Following this, the 'Pick up offers' task is activated, which requires a 'Large quantities?' input, leading to the 'Select your offer' task. The 'Select your offer' task then connects to the 'Specialist' gateway, which also receives the 'Large quantities?' input and directs the process to 'EndEvent0'.


Simultaneously, the 'Filling the package note' and 'Packaging goods' tasks are initiated, both receiving input from the 'ParallelGateway2'. These tasks also connect to 'ParallelGateway3' for further processing.


Finally, the 'Goods are to be shipped' start event triggers the 'Provide goods for collection' end event, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway3'. This marks the completion of the entire process, ensuring that large quantities of goods are shipped with the necessary insurance and packaging.
