 When the 'Schufascoring requested' event occurs, it triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to process the request, which then sends a 'Question answered' notification. Concurrently, the 'Scoring request' event initiates a chain of events starting with 'Transfer Level 1 scoring' and eventually leading to 'Level 1 scoring completed' after passing through 'ParallelGateway3'. Meanwhile, 'EventBasedGateway2' sends a 'Send scoring to FE' message to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn sends a 'Level 2 scoring completed' notification upon successful completion of the scoring process. Additionally, the 'Get notification of delay' event results in a 'Transfer scoring results' message being sent once the scoring process is delayed.
