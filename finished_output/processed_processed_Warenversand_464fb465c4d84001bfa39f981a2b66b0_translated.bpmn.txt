 In the shipping process, the journey of goods begins with the 'Goods must be shipped' event, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and services.

Firstly, the 'Goods must be shipped' event initiates the 'Type of transport' gateway, which in turn sends the goods to the 'Filling the package note' service and the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for creating an 'Insurance close' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods must be shipped' event also triggers the 'ParallelGateway3', which sends the goods to the 'Create a quote request' service and the 'Packaging goods' service. The 'Create a quote request' service connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', while the 'Packaging goods' service connects to the 'Packaging goods' service itself.

The 'ParallelGateway4' gateway, which receives the 'Type of transport' event, sends the goods to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', 'ParallelGateway5', and 'Create a quote' services. The 'Create a quote' service connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' service, upon receiving the 'Insurance close' event, connects to the 'Provide goods for collection' service.

Lastly, the 'Create a quote' service, which receives the 'ParallelGateway4' event, connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

In summary, the 'Goods must be shipped' event sets off a chain of events and interactions between various gateways and services, ensuring that the goods are properly insured, packaged, and shipped to their destination.
