 The process begins with a potential regression against Vietnam (VN), which triggers a payment request to check for any reimbursement issues. This event is connected to the Regression possible? gateway, which then leads to an open state with no money.

Simultaneously, the VN payment request event is linked to the Reimbursement gateway, which also leads to an open state with no money.

If a reimbursement is confirmed, the process moves to the ExclusiveGateway3, which closes the case with a message indicating that money has been received.

Alternatively, if the reimbursement is not confirmed, the process returns to the Regression possible? gateway, which then closes the case with a message indicating that no money is available.

In summary, the process starts with a potential regression against Vietnam, which can lead to either a reimbursement or an open state with no money. If a reimbursement is confirmed, the case is closed with a message indicating that money has been received. If not, the case is closed with a message indicating that no money is available.
