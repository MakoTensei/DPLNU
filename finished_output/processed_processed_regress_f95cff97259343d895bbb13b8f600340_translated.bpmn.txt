 The workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Regression consists of:' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Money received' event, which is the incoming event for the 'Book money receipt' task. The 'Book money receipt' task is then completed, sending an 'EndEvent1' event.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' which leads to the 'Denial of payment justified Check' gateway. This gateway sends a 'Denial of payment justified Check' event, which is the incoming event for the 'Objection' task. The 'Objection' task is then completed, sending an 'EndEvent2' event.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' which sends a 'Debt collection' event, completing the 'Debt collection' task with an 'EndEvent2' event.

Lastly, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' which sends an 'EndEvent0' event, completing the 'Close' task.

In summary, the workflow starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to various tasks and gateways, ultimately resulting in the completion of 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', and 'EndEvent2'.
