 To describe the flow of events in a more natural and flowing description, we can connect the tasks and events as follows:

1. Start the order process by selecting a court.
2. Add your order to the system.
3. The system prepares the meal and informs the employees about the finished meal.
4. The meal is then delivered to the customer.
5. Meanwhile, the system also prepares a meal for Pieper, who will pick it up.
6. Pieper picks up the food from the rich and eats it.
7. The system informs Koch about the order.
8. Koch receives information about the ready meal prepared by Pieper.
9. Every 5 minutes, the system checks if Koch needs to be informed again.
10. If Koch needs to be informed, the system sends the information again.
11. The system delivers the food to the customer and ends the event.
12. If Koch is not informed, the system waits for the next 5-minute interval.
13. Koch visits by name, and the event ends.

This flow connects the tasks and events in a more coherent and understandable manner, ensuring a smooth process from order placement to delivery and customer interaction.
