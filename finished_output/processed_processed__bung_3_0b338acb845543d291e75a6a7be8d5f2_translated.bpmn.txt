 When a regression report arrives, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure the proper handling of the report. First, the report is sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which then decides whether a regression is possible. If a regression is deemed necessary, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway1 and ExclusiveGateway3.

If a regression is not required, the report is sent to Book Payment Receipt, which also connects to ExclusiveGateway1. In the case of a default period expiring or a VN contradiction, the report is directed to ExclusiveGateway1 as well.

Meanwhile, the Debt Collection Office receives the report through EventBasedGateway4 and sends it to ExclusiveGateway1.

If the Debt Collection Office's justification is valid, the process moves to Close the Process, which also connects to ExclusiveGateway1.

Once the process reaches ExclusiveGateway3, it can either proceed to Proceedings or return to ExclusiveGateway1, depending on the outcome of the regression analysis.

Finally, when the process reaches its end, it triggers EndEvent0, which can be initiated by EventBasedGateway4 or ExclusiveGateway1.

In summary, the flow of the regression report handling process is as follows:

1. Regression report arrives and is sent to ExclusiveGateway1.
2. ExclusiveGateway1 determines if a regression is necessary and sends the report to either ExclusiveGateway1 and ExclusiveGateway3 (if a regression is needed) or Book Payment Receipt (if not).
3. If a default period expires or a VN contradiction occurs, the report is sent to ExclusiveGateway1.
4. The Debt Collection Office receives the report through EventBasedGateway4 and sends it to ExclusiveGateway1.
5. If the Debt Collection Office's justification is valid, the process moves to Close the Process, which also connects to ExclusiveGateway1.
6. The process reaches ExclusiveGateway3, which can either
