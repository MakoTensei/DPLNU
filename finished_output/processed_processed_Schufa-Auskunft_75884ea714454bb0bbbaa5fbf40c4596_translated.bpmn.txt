 Upon receiving a Schufascoring request, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process and score the request. The process begins at ExclusiveGateway0, where the request is first received. A follow-up task is then triggered to ensure the results are reported.

Once the scoring process is complete, the results are sent to ExclusiveGateway0, which then forwards the results to ExclusiveGateway1. This step is followed by a delay task, which is then resolved by ExclusiveGateway2. The scoring process continues at ExclusiveGateway2, and upon completion, the results are reported back to ExclusiveGateway1.

Finally, the results are submitted to ExclusiveGateway0, completing the entire process. This sequence of tasks ensures that the Schufascoring request is received, scored, and reported in a timely and efficient manner.
