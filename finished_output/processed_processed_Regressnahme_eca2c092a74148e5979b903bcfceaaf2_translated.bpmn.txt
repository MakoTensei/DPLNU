 When a regression is detected, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. The process begins with the 'Regression found' event, which triggers the 'Send payment prompt' task. This task is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1', where it is processed and subsequently leads to the 'Re-adjust' task. The 'Re-adjust' task, upon receiving the 'Regress possible?' prompt, can either proceed to the 'Check the case' task or return to the 'Send payment prompt' task, depending on the situation.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression found' event also sends a notification to 'EventBasedGateway5'. This event can lead to the 'Proceedings' task, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If the 'Proceedings' task is initiated, it results in the 'Case handed over to debt collection service provider' task, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

Meanwhile, the 'Check the case' task, upon receiving the 'Regress possible?' prompt, can either proceed to the 'Process' task or return to the 'Send payment prompt' task. The 'Process' task, upon receiving the 'EventBasedGateway5' notification, can lead to the 'Close' task, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Finally, the 'Case handed over to debt collection service provider' task, upon receiving the 'Process' notification, is directed to 'handed over to ID'. The 'Process' task, upon receiving the 'EventBasedGateway5' notification, can also lead to the 'Close' task, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

In summary, the sequence of tasks and gateways in response to a 'Regression found' event is as follows:

1. 'Regression found' event triggers 'Send payment prompt' task, directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
2. 'Send payment prompt' task can lead to 'Re-adjust' task or return to 'Send payment prompt' task.
3. 'Regression found' event also sends a notification to 'EventBasedGateway5'.
4. 'EventBasedGateway5' can
