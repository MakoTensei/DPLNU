 In the Court of Justice, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Order and Pay' task. This task is then followed by 'Pieper the', which is connected to 'IntermediateCatchEvent1'. After 'Pieper the' completes, 'Duration Beeping' takes place, leading to the final 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Pieper Set and Hand Over' task. This task is linked to 'Pieper the' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent1'. Upon completion, 'Pieper Set and Hand Over' leads to 'EndEvent1', which in turn triggers the 'Completion Counter-' task. The 'Completion Counter-' task then activates 'Enable Pieper', concluding with 'EndEvent2'.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent2' commences the 'Order to Prepare' task, which is connected to 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. This task results in 'Order in Val Gardena the', which is followed by 'EndEvent3'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent0' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent1' act as gateways, connecting the tasks and events in the process flow.
