 When goods are to be sent, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be sent' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to handle the special shipment. This gateway then directs the goods to the 'Select your offer' task, where customers can choose their offer. Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway4' is activated to handle the packaging of the goods. Once the goods are packaged, they are sent to the 'Packaging goods' task, which then routes them to the 'ParallelGateway5'. After the goods are packaged, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated to document the contents and details of the shipment. The 'Insurance close' task is also triggered if insurance is required, which sends the goods to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' for processing. Finally, the goods are ready for collection, marking the end of the process with the 'Goods ready for collection' event.
