 Starting with the event 'Information about possible Regression', the process unfolds as follows:

1. The event 'Information about possible Regression' triggers the 'Regression possible' gateway, which in turn sends the event to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway1' itself.

2. 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the event and sends it to 'Regression Finished' and 'Opposition Justified' gateways.

3. The 'Opposition Justified' gateway, upon receiving the event, sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

4. 'ExclusiveGateway4' sends the event to 'Debt Collection', while 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends it to 'Regression Finished'.

5. Meanwhile, 'Regression Finished' sends the event to 'Debt Collection' and 'Regression Finished' itself.

6. The 'Debt Collection' gateway receives the event and sends it to 'Regression Finished'.

7. The 'Regression Finished' gateway receives the event and marks the end of the process.

In summary, the event 'Information about possible Regression' initiates a series of gateways and tasks, ultimately leading to the completion of 'Regression Finished'.
