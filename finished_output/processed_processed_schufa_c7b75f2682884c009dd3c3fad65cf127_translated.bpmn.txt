 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the "Schufascoring Question" event, which triggers the "Scoring request obtained" event. This request is then directed to the "Scoring successful?" event, which is an exclusive gateway named "ExclusiveGateway1". If the scoring is successful, the system proceeds to the "Scoring Level 2 perform" event, which is another exclusive gateway named "EventBasedGateway2". Upon successful completion of Level 2 scoring, the system sends a "forwarding the scoring" message to the "Delay Message Obtained" event, which is an event-based gateway. Finally, the system concludes the scoring process by sending the "Scoring Ship" event, which is triggered by the "Scoring Level 2 perform" event.
