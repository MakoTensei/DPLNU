 Upon receiving a 'Regression possibility submitted' event, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the potential regression case. First, a 'Check regression case' task is triggered, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If the case is deemed unsuccessful, the system proceeds to 'WV occurred', leading to a 'Regression case forwarded' outcome. Conversely, if the case is successful, a 'Regression\nsuccessful\nFinished' event is logged.


Simultaneously, a 'Send payment request' task is activated, linking to 'In WV'. This task is independent of the regression case's outcome and is processed in parallel.


In the event of a successful regression case, the system also handles an 'Opposition incoming' event, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If the opposition is justified, the case is forwarded to 'Regression case\nforwarded'. If not, the case is marked as 'Regression case\nunsuccessful\nFinished'.


For an unsuccessful regression case, the system also processes an 'In WV' event, which connects to 'WV occurred'. This leads to a 'Regression case\nforwarded' outcome.


Lastly, an 'Incoming payment\nNot applicable' event, which is independent of the regression case, connects to 'EventBasedGateway4'. If the payment is successful, the system logs a 'Regression\nsuccessful\nFinished' event. If not, the case is marked as 'Regression case\nunsuccessful\nFinished'.


This flow ensures that all possible outcomes of the regression case are handled efficiently, with parallel processing of unrelated tasks like payment requests.
