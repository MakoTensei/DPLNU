 When a possible regression is identified, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, a task is created to check the case, which is assigned the ID'sid-D1D6306C-5A59-4B1E-90CF-691B897638AD' and is named 'Check the case'. This task has incoming triggers from a 'possible regression' and outgoing triggers to 'Regress possible'.

Next, a task is created to send a payment request, with the ID'sid-1DA83AA8-8F4B-4300-8D7C-5A3CD4A06424' and named 'Send payment request'. This task also has incoming triggers from a 'possible regression' and outgoing triggers to'set to reimbursement'.

Once the payment request is sent, the system proceeds to close the case. This is done through a task with the ID'sid-EE220D09-CA1D-46FB-8168-DD6D1B421AA5' and named 'Close'. The task has incoming triggers from 'Regress possible' and outgoing triggers to 'EndEvent0'.

After the case is closed, the system book a payment receipt. This is achieved through a task with the ID'sid-64E33E76-EE2E-42F1-BE49-F32058F0417B' and named 'Book payment receipt'. The task has incoming triggers from 'Money received' and outgoing triggers to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The system then proceeds to the next step, which is to handle the reimbursement period. This is done through a task with the ID'sid-1AC66867-E5C5-4085-9BA9-0246BB1DE9D4' and named 'Proceedings'. The task has incoming triggers from 'Opposition' and outgoing triggers to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Once the reimbursement period is over, the system hands over the case to collection. This
