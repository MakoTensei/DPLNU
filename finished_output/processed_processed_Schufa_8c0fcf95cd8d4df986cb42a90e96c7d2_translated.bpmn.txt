 When the 'StartEvent0' initiates the process, it triggers the 'Pick up Schufascoring' task, which then proceeds to the 'Scoring' task. The 'Scoring' task, upon completion, sends the 'Scoring result' to the 'Scoring result?' gateway, which in turn sends the result to the 'EndEvent0' and also sends a'received delay' message to the'received delay' gateway. Meanwhile, the 'Information about delay' gateway receives the'received delay' message and sends it to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Simultaneously, the 'Run scoring level 1\n' and 'Run scoring level 2' tasks send their results to the 'Scoring result sent' gateway, which then sends the final scoring result to the 'EndEvent0'.
