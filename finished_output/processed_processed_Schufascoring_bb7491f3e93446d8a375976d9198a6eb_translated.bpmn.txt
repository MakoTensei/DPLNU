 In the scoring process, a request is initiated by the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1'. This event captures any intermediate results and sends them to the 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent2' begins the determination of scoring, which is directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then sends the scoring results to the 'Send Scoring results' task and also leads to the 'EndEvent1'. The 'Determine final scoring result' task, which is also connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', concludes the scoring process by sending the final results to the 'EndEvent1'. This sequence ensures a smooth flow of tasks and events, from initiating the scoring request to reporting the final results.
