 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive way, fitting them into a single paragraph:

When a guest experiences hunger, they are prompted to select a meal, which leads to an order being placed. The order is then processed, and the guest is instructed to wait in the row. As the meal is being prepared, the system records the order in the cash register system. Once the meal is ready, the system sends a notification to the guest, and they are informed that their meal is ready for pickup. The guest then picks up their meal, and the system records this event. The meal is then taken to the guest, and the system adjusts the beeps and outputs to inform the staff. The staff, Koch, is then notified that the meal is ready. After triggering the beeps, the meal is left for the guest, and the order is marked as completed.

In parallel, when a guest is hungry, they are asked if they have an issue, which leads to a gateway event. If the guest has no issue, they are directed to select a meal. If the guest has an issue, the system retrieves information about the guest and their issue.

Additionally, when the meal preparation requires grinding time, the system informs the employees and provides them with the necessary information.

The process concludes when the meal is ready, and the guest is notified. The guest then receives their meal, and the order is marked as completed. If the guest has an issue, the system also retrieves information about the guest and their issue.

Finally, when the meal is ready, the system triggers an event that leads to the guest being notified that they are famished, and the order is marked as completed.
