 The process begins with the possibility of a VN taking a regression, which triggers a series of events and gateways.

1. The 'VN possibly to take in Regress' event initiates the process.
2. The 'Possibility for a regression?' event checks if the VN is likely to take a regression.
3. If the VN is likely to take a regression, the 'Process close' event is triggered, and the VN is not in Regressed.
4. If the VN contradicts, the 'Opposition Check' event is triggered, and the 'Opposition justified?' event is initiated.
5. If the opposition is justified, the 'Opposition granted' event is triggered.
6. The 'EventBasedGateway2' event is triggered, which leads to the 'Regression completed' event and the 'Opposition granted' event.
7. The 'EventBasedGateway2' event also leads to the 'Date of expiry' event.
8. The 'Money received' event is triggered, which leads to the 'Regression completed' event.
9. The 'Process close' event is triggered at the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the possibility of a VN taking a regression, which triggers a series of events and gateways. If the VN contradicts, the opposition is justified, and the opposition is granted. The regression is completed, and the process ends with the VN not in Regressed.
