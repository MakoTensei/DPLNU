 In the process flow, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Regression possible?' gateway. If the regression is possible, the system proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and can also route to'sid-FF763AFD-60BB-4903-927D-CD3430D3E100'. If the regression is not possible, the system moves to the 'Rejection of payment' event, which is handled by 'EventBasedGateway4'. This event can lead to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

When 'ExclusiveGateway2' is reached, the system checks for payment refusal and if found, it closes the regression process and ends the event. If the payment is not refused, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection. If the payment is rejected, the system routes to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and can also route to'sid-CFC423D7-1153-4E45-A464-18C4C086BE55'.

If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection again. If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection one more time. If the payment is rejected, the system routes to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection one more time. If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection one more time. If the payment is rejected, the system routes to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection one more time. If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection one more time. If the payment is rejected, the system routes to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment rejection one more time. If the payment is not rejected, the system checks for the possibility of a payment re
