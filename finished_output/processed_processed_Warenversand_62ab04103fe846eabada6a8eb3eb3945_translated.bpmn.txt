 Starting with the event where goods are dispatched and labeled as "Goods dispatched they are," the process flows through the following sequence of tasks and gateways:

1. The goods dispatched event triggers ParallelGateway4, which is the incoming gateway for this event.
2. ParallelGateway4 then sends the goods dispatched event to ParallelGateway6 and ParallelGateway9.
3. ParallelGateway6, in turn, is the incoming gateway for the task "Filling the package note."
1. The task "Filling the package note" is initiated and has ParallelGateway6 as its incoming gateway.
2. ParallelGateway6 sends the task to ExclusiveGateway2, which is the outgoing gateway for this task.
3. ExclusiveGateway2, upon receiving the task, forwards it to ParallelGateway9.
4. The task "Filling the package note" concludes at ParallelGateway9, which is the outgoing gateway for this task.

The process ends with the event "product retrieval," which is triggered by ParallelGateway9. This event has ExclusiveGateway0 as its incoming gateway and concludes the sequence of events.
