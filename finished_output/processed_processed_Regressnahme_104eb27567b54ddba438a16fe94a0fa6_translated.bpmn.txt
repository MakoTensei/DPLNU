 Starting with the event 'possible\nRegression' (sid-57B3CEC0-3E41-4219-98D8-C687F5C1FBA1), the system initiates a series of tasks and checks to ensure the integrity of the process. The event triggers the 'Regression Check' (sid-sid-4D84939D-A172-438C-8159-FFD32C58A23A), which is designed to verify if there are any regressions in the system. This check is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-F36222CB-C419-4AAD-A38A-21D5E82C1B6B), which further leads to the 'Process\nclose' (sid-F36222CB-C419-4AAD-A38A-21D5E82C1B6B) task.

Simultaneously, the 'possible\nRegression' event also triggers the 'Opposition\nCheck' (sid-sid-6755F44A-CF91-4A3E-9B01-950BE99C47B3) task, which is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway3' (sid-F36222CB-C419-4AAD-A38A-21D5E82C1B6B). This check is essential to ensure that there are no opposing factors that could affect the process.

Meanwhile, the 'possible\nRegression' event also initiates the 'Payment\non request\nsend' (sid-sid-C51E9600-6F10-400B-968E-86F8C8E21DEB) task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5' (sid-sid-6FA83615-A777-429B-937B-1
