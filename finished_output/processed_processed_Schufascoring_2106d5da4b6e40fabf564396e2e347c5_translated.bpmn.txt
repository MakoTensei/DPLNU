 When a request for Schufa scoring is received, the system initiates the 'Pick up Schufa scoring' process, which will later report back the results. Concurrently, a scoring request for debt level 1 is discussed, leading to the 'EndEvent2' being triggered. Meanwhile, the 'Socred (level 2)' process is initiated, and the final score is notified. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' acts as a decision point for the scoring request, directing it to either 'EndEvent2' or the 'Final score' notification. Upon completion of the Schufa scoring, the system reports back the results.
