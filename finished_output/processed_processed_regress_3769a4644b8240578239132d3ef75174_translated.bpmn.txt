 When a Vendor Number (VN) is taken into regress, the following sequence of tasks and gateways is triggered:

1. The VN taken in Regress triggers the "Check regression" task, which sends a message to the "ExclusiveGateway0" to proceed with the process.

2. The "ExclusiveGateway0" then forwards the message to the "Book payment receipt" task, which records the payment receipt for the VN.

3. The "Book payment receipt" task sends the message to the "EndEvent1" to mark the completion of the process.

4. Meanwhile, the "Check regression" task also sends a message to the "Prompt payment by VN" task, which initiates the prompt payment process.

5. The "Prompt payment by VN" task sends a message to the "ExclusiveGateway2" to proceed with the process.

6. The "ExclusiveGateway2" then forwards the message to the "Proceedings" task, which moves the VN to the next stage.

7. The "Proceedings" task sends a message to the "EndEvent2" to mark the completion of the process.

8. Concurrently, the "Check regression" task sends a message to the "handed over to debt collection companies" task, which initiates the debt collection process.

9. The "handed over to debt collection companies" task sends messages to the "EndEvent3" and "EventBasedGateway3" to mark the completion of the process and to handle the VN accordingly.

10. The "EventBasedGateway3" receives the message from the "VN taken in Regress" and sends messages to the "EndEvent1" and "EndEvent2" to mark the completion of the process.

11. Additionally, the "EventBasedGateway3" also receives the message from the "Default period expired" task, which triggers the "EndEvent3" to mark the completion of the process.

In summary, when a VN is taken in Regress, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways that handle the regress, prompt payment, proceedings, and deb
