 In this project, we have a team consisting of Alice, Bob, and Charlie, who are responsible for various tasks. Alice is in charge of conducting market research to identify potential customer needs and preferences. Bob's role involves designing and developing a user-friendly interface for the product, ensuring it meets the requirements identified by Alice. Meanwhile, Charlie focuses on the technical aspects, such as coding and testing the product to ensure its functionality and reliability. Together, they collaborate to create a successful product that meets the market's demands and provides a seamless user experience.
