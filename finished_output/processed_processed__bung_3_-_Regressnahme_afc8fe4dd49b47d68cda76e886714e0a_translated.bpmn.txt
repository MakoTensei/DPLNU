 In the financial operations system, a series of tasks and gateways are interconnected to ensure the smooth processing of transactions and events. When a 'Regression report' is generated, it triggers the 'Check regression' task, which then sends the report to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. If the report indicates that the process is 'Not justified', the task transitions to the 'Not justified' state and closes the process.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression report' also triggers the 'VN payment request' task, which sends the report to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. If the report is not justified, the task proceeds to 'Incoming payment' and closes the process.

The 'Regression report' also initiates the 'Proceedings' task, which sends the report to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the report is not justified, the task transitions to 'Disclosure of debt collection' and closes the process.

Additionally, the 'Regression report' triggers the 'Book payment receipt' task, which sends the report to 'Incoming payment'. If the report is not justified, the task transitions to 'Close process'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' event, which is received by 'Reference', sends the 'Regression report' to both 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the report is not justified, the task transitions to 'Disclosure of debt collection' and closes the process.

Finally, the 'Close process' event is triggered by both 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway1', which closes the process and marks the end of the workflow.
