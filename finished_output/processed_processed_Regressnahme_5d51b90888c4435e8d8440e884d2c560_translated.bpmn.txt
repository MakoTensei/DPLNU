 The process begins with the event 'VN can be regressed they are' (sid-A310BA47-6796-47C3-B867-1271F723AD13). This event triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway (sid-836FBF2B-5F64-4245-A684-F64895916C86). If the regress is possible, the process proceeds to 'Process closed (No regression possible)' (sid-01AE3948-53E6-42E1-8649-809FD03D4944). If the regress is not possible, the process moves to 'Set process for resubmission' (sid-sid-0EC008D2-0179-4DC7-B33B-EDB8C25E035F).

If the regress is not possible and the process for resubmission is set, the 'Cash receipt' event (sid-4AD69089-15B8-4324-828D-0E4CFA5F7099) is triggered. This event leads to 'Process closed (money receipt)' (sid-E2F378F1-06E8-4E3A-95FC-27A2D66D327).

If the regress is not possible and the process for resubmission is set, the 'Opposition justified?' event (sid-84E96F9F-E8FB-4723-898B-EB708C919B78) is triggered. This leads to two possible outcomes: 'Process closed (Rejection)' (sid-3B19DE29-253E-4CA2-94E9-192D6FED8069) and 'VN to debt collection office delivered' (sid-F7112F19-B923-
