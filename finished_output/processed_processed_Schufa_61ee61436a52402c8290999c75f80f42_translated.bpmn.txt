 In a flowing narrative, the system processes scoring requests through a series of interconnected components. When a request for scoring is initiated, it first reaches the 'Sufa\nScoring\nRequest' start event, which then triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' gateway. This gateway, identified by'sid-1862460C-73B8-4598-BAEF-774B83A0BE43', determines the scoring outcome and sends the result to the 'Scoring\nDeterminable' gateway, identified by'sid-A333E4B4-C8B3-4C88-98B7-058A3354FE1A'. The 'Scoring\nDeterminable' gateway then forwards the result to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', identified by'sid-70A99010-8559-49F5-9193-C082F8D8B448'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' has two outgoing paths: one leading to the 'EndEvent0' and another to the 'Scoring\nobtained' gateway, identified by'sid-60E93A06-86AD-4D78-B2CE-7D21B5D2FC3B'. The 'Scoring\nobtained' gateway, in turn, sends the result to the 'EndEvent1', identified by'sid-6A9BD629-A63C-4014-A3C5-AF7E120FA25B'.

Meanwhile, the 'Suffa\nScoring\nRequest' start event also triggers the 'Delay message\nobtained' gateway, identified by'sid-75A95A3C-D43D-4D7D-88E4-4F6F4985123A'. This gateway receives the result from the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends it to the'sid-7A37
