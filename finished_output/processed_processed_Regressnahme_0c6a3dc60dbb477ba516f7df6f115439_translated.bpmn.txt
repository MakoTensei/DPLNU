 In a seamless workflow, the 'Check regression' task, identified by'sid-77A1D293-F45B-405C-8B8C-BB4EEE724C59', initiates the process by receiving a 'StartEvent0'. This task then proceeds to the 'ParallelGateway5', where it can either lead to the 'Book the entrance' task,'sid-503C77EE-101A-422B-BE30-D854562D1400', which is triggered by 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' and subsequently directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', or it can branch off to the 'Proceedings' task,'sid-3BDDBE2C-DB3F-43B7-B91C-330799BE579A', which is activated by 'IntermediateCatchEvent7' and leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


Alternatively, the 'Check regression' task can also result in the 'Set on re-submission' task,'sid-233C8CF9-7271-4A02-A83D-E554515A8491', which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway5' and subsequently leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent7'. This task can also diverge to the 'Send payment request' task,'sid-916C3300-CDC7-4444-A537-65E8994C9866', which is also initiated by 'ParallelGateway5' and concludes with 'EndEvent2'.


Lastly, the 'Close' task,'sid-BDC4E8AE-8BBB-496E-A6E9-1BF84599A227', is the final step in the process, receiving input from 'EventBasedGateway4' and culminating in 'EndEvent0'. This task effectively wraps up the entire workflow, ensuring that all preceding
