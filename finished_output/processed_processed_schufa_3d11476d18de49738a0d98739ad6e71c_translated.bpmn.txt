 When a scoring request is received, the system initiates a sequence of events and interactions between various components to process the request. The process begins with the 'Receive scoring request' event, which triggers the 'Testing successful' gateway to send a 'Testing successfully send' message to the 'perform scoring level 1' gateway, indicating that the initial testing phase has been completed successfully.

The 'perform scoring level 1' gateway then sends a 'Testing successfully send' message to the 'Testing successful' gateway, which in turn sends a 'Send scoring request' message to the 'Receive scoring request' event, signaling the start of the next phase.

The 'Receive scoring request' event triggers the 'Receive delay message' event, which sends a'receive delay message' to the 'End result obtained' event, indicating that the scoring process is still ongoing.

The 'End result obtained' event sends a 'Send a final result' message to the 'Send a final result' gateway, which then sends the final result to the appropriate recipient.

Meanwhile, the 'perform scoring level 2' gateway receives the'sid-5D952BBD-8627-4173-B443-0F4E628FF997' message from the 'Testing successful' gateway, indicating that the second level of scoring has been completed. The 'perform scoring level 2' gateway then sends a 'Send a final result' message to the 'Send a final result' gateway, which sends the final result to the recipient.

In summary, the scoring request is received, and the system processes it through a series of events and interactions between various gateways and components, ultimately sending the final result to the recipient.
