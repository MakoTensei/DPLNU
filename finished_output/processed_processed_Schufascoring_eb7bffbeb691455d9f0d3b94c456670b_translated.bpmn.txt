 The process begins with the 'Start Scoring Request' event, where a scoring request is obtained and directed to the ExclusiveGateway0. This initiates the scoring process.

Once the scoring request is obtained, the 'Continue Scoring Result (Level 1)' task is triggered. This task continues the scoring process for Level 1 and sends the obtained scoring result to ExclusiveGateway0.

Following the completion of Level 1 scoring, the 'Continue Scoring Result (Level 2)' task is initiated. This task continues the scoring process for Level 2 and sends the obtained scoring result to ExclusiveGateway0.

After Level 2 scoring, the 'Scoring Result (Level 2) Available' event is triggered. This event checks if the scoring result for Level 2 is available and sends a message to ResultAvailable? gateway.

Upon receiving the message from ResultAvailable? gateway, the 'Conduct Scoring (Level 2)' task is initiated. This task conducts the scoring for Level 2 and sends the obtained scoring result to ExclusiveGateway0.

Once the scoring for Level 2 is completed, the 'Scoring Result (Level 2) Available' event is triggered again to check if the scoring result for Level 2 is available.

After confirming the availability of the Level 2 scoring result, the 'Scoring Ends' event is triggered. This event marks the end of the scoring process and sends a message to the EventBasedGateway2.

Finally, the 'Scoring Ends' event is triggered again to confirm the end of the scoring process.

Throughout this process, the ExclusiveGateway0 and EventBasedGateway2 gateways play crucial roles in directing the flow of tasks and ensuring the scoring process is conducted smoothly.
