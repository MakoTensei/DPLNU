 A person experiences hunger, triggering the start of an event. They decide to visit a restaurant, which involves selecting a court, adding their order, and paying for their meal. Once the payment is made, they pick up their food and start eating. After consuming the food, they no longer feel hungry.

Simultaneously, the restaurant's operations are also triggered by the start event. The restaurant prepares the court, and the court of first instance is established.

The restaurant's operations are managed by an exclusive gateway, which handles the distribution of the court and the retrieval of customers. The exclusive gateway also sends a 5-minute timer to retrieve the customer after they have finished eating.

In summary, the person's hunger leads to a series of actions that involve visiting a restaurant, ordering food, and eating. At the same time, the restaurant's operations are initiated, and the exclusive gateway manages the flow of customers and the timing of their retrieval.
