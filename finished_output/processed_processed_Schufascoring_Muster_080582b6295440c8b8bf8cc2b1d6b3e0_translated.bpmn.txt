 In the banking system, a scoring request initiated by 'The Bank' triggers a series of events and interactions between various gateways and tasks. The process begins with the 'Scoring request' from 'The Bank', which is received by the 'Scoring request' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Scoring result transmitted' message to the 'Scoring result transmitted' gateway, marking the completion of the initial scoring process.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring request' gateway also sends a 'Report delay to Bank' message to the 'Report delay to Bank' gateway. This gateway receives a 'Delay input obtained' message from the 'Delay input obtained' gateway, indicating that the delay has been obtained. In response, the 'Report delay to Bank' gateway sends a 'Scoring result transmitted' message to the 'Scoring result transmitted' gateway, indicating that the delay has been reported to the bank.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' gateway also sends a 'Determine delay' message to the 'Determine delay' gateway. This gateway receives a 'Delay input wait' message from the 'Delay input wait' gateway, indicating that the delay has been obtained. The 'Determine delay' gateway then sends a 'Scoring result transmitted' message to the 'Scoring result transmitted' gateway, indicating that the delay has been determined.

Furthermore, the 'Scoring request' gateway sends a 'perform scoring level 2' message to the 'perform scoring level 2' gateway. This gateway receives a 'Delay we have taken place' message from the 'Delay we have taken place' gateway, indicating that the delay has been taken into account. The 'perform scoring level 2' gateway then sends a 'Scoring result transmitted' message to the 'Scoring result transmitted' gateway, indicating that the scoring level 2 has been performed and the result has been transmitted.

In summary, the banking system processes a scoring request from 'The Bank' through a series of events and interactions between gateways and tasks. The process involves obtaining and reporting delays, determining the delay, and performing scoring level 2, ultimately resulting in the transmission of the scoring result back to 'The Bank'.
