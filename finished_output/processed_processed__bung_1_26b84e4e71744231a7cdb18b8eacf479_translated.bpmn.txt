 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then routes the incoming task to 'Transport insurance' and 'Select your offer'. The 'Transport insurance' task is directed to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn sends the task to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Select your offer' task is also directed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which routes it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway sends the task to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives tasks from 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Fill in the package certificate\n'. It then sends these tasks to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Packaging goods' task, which comes from 'ParallelGateway4', is directed to 'Delivering goods' through 'ParallelGateway5'. This task also receives the 'Fill in the package certificate\n' task from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Request a quote' task, originating from 'ExclusiveGateway0', is directed to 'Select your offer' through 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task also sends the 'Select your offer' task to 'EndEvent0'.

Lastly, the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task, coming from 'StartEvent0', is directed to 'ParallelGateway5' which then sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0' and ends with 'EndEvent0', with various tasks being routed through different gateways based on their incoming and outgoing connections.
