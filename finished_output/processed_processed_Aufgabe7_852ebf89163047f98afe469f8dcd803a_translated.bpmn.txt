 In the system, a scoring request and report are initiated, triggering a series of events and interactions between various components.

1. The scoring request and report are first received by the EventBasedGateway2, which then forwards the request to the IntermediateCatchEvent3.
2. IntermediateCatchEvent3 sends the request to the ExclusiveGateway0, which in turn sends the request to the Level2 scoring process.
3. Level2 scoring, upon completion, sends the results to the EndEvent0.
4. Concurrently, the request for Schufa-Auskunft is received by the Ergenis present? gateway.
5. The Ergenis present? gateway sends the request to the EndEvent1 and EndEvent2.
6. EndEvent1 and EndEvent2, upon completion, send a reply to the Ergenis present? gateway.

In summary, the system processes a scoring request and report by passing it through various gateways and events, ultimately resulting in the generation of scoring results and a response to the Ergenis present? query.
