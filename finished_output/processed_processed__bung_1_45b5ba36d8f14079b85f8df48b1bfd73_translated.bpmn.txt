 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the packaging of goods. This is followed by the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway4' and results in the creation of a shipping document. Concurrently, the 'large shipping quantity?' event is triggered, leading to the 'Filling the package note' task, which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Once the shipping document is created, the 'Apply parcel note' task is triggered, which also connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Delivering goods' task is then initiated, which connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Packaging goods' task is completed, and the goods are ready for collection.

The 'Delivery document of the goods' task is triggered, which connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Insurance close' task is initiated, which connects to 'Is insurance necessary?' and results in a note on the package. Finally, the 'Goods are ready for collection' event is triggered, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the process involves packaging the goods, choosing the cheapest offer, filling the package note, applying the parcel note, delivering the goods, creating a delivery document, and finally, preparing the goods for collection.
