 The process begins with the 'Regression report' event, which triggers the 'Order payment request' task. This task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the 'Set process for resubmission' task to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Set process for resubmission' task is followed by the 'Money received' event, which sends the 'Complete the process' task to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is then routed to 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Representation expired' event is also routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which sends the 'Dispense process to debt collection office' task to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'VN contradicts' event is routed to 'EventBasedGateway3', which sends the 'Dispense process to debt collection office' task to 'EndEvent2'.

In summary, the process involves handling a 'Regression report' to initiate a payment request, managing the resubmission process, and handling representation expiration and VN contradictions. The process concludes with 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', and 'EndEvent2'.
