 When a regression is submitted, the system initiates a series of processes to handle the submission. First, the system checks the possibility of the regression, which is triggered by the incoming event 'Regression submitted'. This event connects to the 'Regression possibility?' gateway, which has outgoing connections to the 'Payment method send to VN' and 'Notification' tasks.

If the regression is deemed possible, the system then sets up a process for re-submission, which is triggered by the 'Regression submitted' event and connects to the 'Set process for re-submission' task. This task has an outgoing connection to the 'Reimbursement period expired?' task.

If the reimbursement period has expired, the system processes the re-submission by sending the payment method to VN, which is triggered by the 'Reimbursement period expired?' event and connects to the 'Payment method send to VN' task.

Once the payment method is sent to VN, the system notifies the relevant parties about the re-submission, which is triggered by the 'Payment method send to VN' event and connects to the 'Notification' task.

If the reimbursement period has not expired, the system processes the re-submission by passing it on to the collection, which is triggered by the 'Regression submitted' event and connects to the 'Process passed on to collection' task.

The 'Process passed on to collection' task has an outgoing connection to the 'Opposition justified?' task, which is triggered by the 'Process passed on to collection' event and connects to the 'Opposition justified?' task.

If the opposition is justified, the system notifies the relevant parties about the opposition, which is triggered by the 'Opposition justified?' event and connects to the 'Notification' task.

Finally, when the process is closed, the system marks the end of the event, which is triggered by the 'Process closed' event and connects to the 'EndEvent' task.
