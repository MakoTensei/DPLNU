 When a case is flagged as "VN in Regress," it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to handle the situation. First, the case is checked by the "Take VN to Regress?" gateway, which has the ID'sid-604CB59A-49C3-43A6-90ED-BD1F06D943EA'. This gateway has two outgoing paths: one leading to the "ExclusiveGateway3" and another to the "Process" task.

If the case is deemed to be in regress, it is then sent to the "ExclusiveGateway3" with the ID'sid-E2FDD069-2947-4DBC-8693-98C2779D3A72'. This gateway has three incoming paths: "EventBasedGateway4," "Check the case," and "VN." The outgoing path from "ExclusiveGateway3" leads to the "Process" task.
