 The process begins with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then checks the case. If the case is not justified, it leads to 'Case completed without result'.

If the case is justified, the process moves to 'Set process in WV', which sends a 'Money\nReport' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This report can result in two outcomes: 'Case successful\ncompleted' or 'Case forwarded to debt collection'.

If the case is not justified, the 'Money\nReport' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which forwards the case to 'Debt Collection'.

The 'EventBasedGateway4' can also trigger the process. If it does, the case can be completed successfully or forwarded to debt collection.

In case the 'WV expired' event occurs, the process is redirected to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which can lead to the case being forwarded to debt collection.

This process ensures that all possible outcomes are covered, and the case is handled appropriately based on the incoming events and the decisions made by the gateways.
