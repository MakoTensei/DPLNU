 In a scoring system, a StartEvent0 initiates the process by triggering a Report Level 2 task, which is responsible for reporting the initial scoring results. Concurrently, a StartEvent1 kicks off the submission process, leading to a Submitting results task.

The Scoring request task, identified by sid-E2B47C44-EEE4-4FE1-8EEF-CAFA3A0AF71F, begins the scoring process and sends a signal to IntermediateCatchEvent4. This event acts as a checkpoint, ensuring that the scoring request has been received and processed.

Once the scoring request is processed, the IntermediateCatchEvent4 sends a signal to the Submitting results task, identified by sid-2F84DD88-C699-4002-834C-380EBD7D2B6D. This task is responsible for submitting the final scoring results.

Simultaneously, the Report Level 2 task, identified by sid-005D4B39-D061-4143-8D1C-80FF79A57260, completes its reporting process and sends a signal to EndEvent0.

The Run scoring level 1 task, identified by sid-A67B7BA9-C081-400B-B4BB-5DEFE5A2BAC4, starts the first level of scoring and sends a signal to ParallelGateway1.

ParallelGateway1, identified by sid-0058FC50-064B-427F-A082-F3E6E5C493B3, receives the signal from Run scoring level 1 and sends a signal to EndEvent1.

The Run scoring level 2 task, identified by sid-6BDD0832-6515-48AC-AD3F-3E0B627FAF1F, starts the second level of scoring and sends a signal to Submitting results.
