 Upon receiving a scoring request, the system initiates a series of tasks to process the request and provide the necessary information to the bank. Here's a flow of events:

1. The system receives a scoring request and sends a message to ExclusiveGateway0, which is responsible for handling the request.
2. ExclusiveGateway0 processes the request and sends the customer information to the customer information gateway.
3. The customer information gateway retrieves the customer details and sends them to the bank.
4. The bank receives the customer information and sends a question about the scoring level back to the system.
5. The system receives the question and sends a message to Scoring Result Level1? gateway.
6. The Scoring Result Level1? gateway processes the question and sends the result to EndEvent1.
7. If the result indicates that Scoring Level 2 is successful, the system sends a message to Scoring Level 2 successful? gateway.
8. The Scoring Level 2 successful? gateway processes the result and sends the information to EndEvent2.
9. If the result indicates that Scoring Level 2 is not successful, the system sends a message to No scoring possible gateway.
10. The No scoring possible gateway processes the result and sends the information to Info to Bank gateway.
11. The Info to Bank gateway sends the information to EndEvent3.

In summary, the system processes the scoring request by sending it to ExclusiveGateway0, which then sends the customer information to the customer information gateway. The bank receives the customer information and sends a question about the scoring level back to the system. The system processes the question and sends the result to the appropriate end event based on the outcome of the scoring process.
