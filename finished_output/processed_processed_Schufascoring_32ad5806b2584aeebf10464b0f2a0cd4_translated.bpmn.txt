 When a customer makes a request, the system initiates a sequence of events to process the request. The process begins with a 'Customer request' event, which triggers the 'Send delay message' task to handle the request with a delay. This task is linked to both 'Customer request' and 'Schufa request' start events.

Simultaneously, a 'Schufa request' event also initiates a 'Send delay message' task. The 'Level 1 Scoring' task, triggered by the 'Schufa request', sends the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then directs the results to the 'EndEvent1' task.

The 'Level 2 Scoring' task, triggered by the 'Results immediately\nfound?' event, also sends the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway, in turn, sends the results to the 'EndEvent1' task.

The 'EndEvent1' task is the final step in the process, receiving inputs from both 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Results immediately\nfound?' events.

In summary, the system processes a customer's request by sending a delay message, performing level 1 and level 2 scoring, and finally concluding the process with an end event.
