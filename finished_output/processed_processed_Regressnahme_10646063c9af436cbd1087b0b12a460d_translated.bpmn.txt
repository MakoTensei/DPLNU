 In a case study, the process begins with a 'Regress possible' event, which triggers the 'Take in Regress' gateway. This gateway then leads to the 'Process' end event. Concurrently, the 'Set process for resubmission' task is initiated, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway5' gateway upon receiving a 'Reimbursement' event. The 'ExclusiveGateway5' gateway further leads to the 'Dispense process to debt management' task. Meanwhile, the 'Book the entrance' task is triggered by a 'Cash receipt' event, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway5'. The 'Proceedings' task is initiated by a 'Notification' event, which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'. Lastly, the 'Not justified' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway4', leading to the 'Process' end event.
