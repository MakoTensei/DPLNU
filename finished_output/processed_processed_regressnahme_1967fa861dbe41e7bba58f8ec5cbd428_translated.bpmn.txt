 The process begins with the event 'Powerful regression reported to VN', which triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway. This gateway has two outgoing paths:'sid-142AB7D6-1636-47CC-87FC-28BE2499257C' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then leads to the 'Close' task if the 'Opposition justified?' event occurs, which is triggered by the 'Objection of VN Report'. This event also has a path to 'Opposition justified?' gateway. If the 'Opposition justified?' event is triggered, it leads to the 'Close' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Regress possible?' gateway also leads to the 'Proceedings' task if the 'Objection of VN Report' event occurs. The 'Proceedings' task then leads to the 'Opposition justified?' event.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' is triggered by the 'Regress possible?' gateway and leads to the 'Close' task if the 'Opposition justified?' event occurs. It also leads to the 'Reimbursement period expired' task.

The 'Reimbursement period expired' task, triggered by 'EventBasedGateway3', leads to the'sid-1A43F28B-453B-4D24-935F-27D4DF58459E' task.

Finally, the 'Case completed' task is triggered by 'EventBasedGateway3' and leads to the end of the process.
