 The process begins with the 'Order of goods' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle the order. The order then goes through the 'ParallelGateway2', which receives the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway3'. 'ParallelGateway3' receives the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'Check quantity'. The 'Check quantity' event sends the order to 'ParallelGateway3' again, which then sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway2' also receives the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' event receives the order from 'ParallelGateway2' and sends it to 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'Pick up offers' event sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway3', which then sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Insurance close' event sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway4', which then sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'ParallelGateway6' receives the offer from 'Lot?' and sends it to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Preparing a package ticket' event sends the ticket to 'ParallelGateway7', which then sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

Finally, the 'Delivering goods' event sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway7', which then sends them to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:

1. 'Order of goods' event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle the order.
2. 'ParallelGateway2' receives the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'EndEvent0'.
3. 'ParallelGateway3' receives the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'Check quantity'.
4. 'Check quantity' event sends the order to 'ParallelGateway3' again, which then sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1
