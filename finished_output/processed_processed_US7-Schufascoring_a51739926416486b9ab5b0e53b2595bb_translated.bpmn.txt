 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Start scoring request' task, which then connects to'sid-C4FBF8F6-AB56-4B6B-ABB0-47DC54BEB865'. Following this, the 'Wait for scoring' task is activated by 'StartEvent1', leading to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and subsequently the 'Scoring Level 1' task, which is linked to'sid-44D86511-A75B-453F-997C-1B4EDE6C795E'. The 'Scoring Level 2' task is then triggered by'sid-F52AC25F-ADF5-459A-82BC-BDD4D4B33C0C', both of which converge at the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Upon completion of the scoring levels, the 'Delivering results' task is initiated, which is connected to'sid-0E2A58C8-0778-4369-BA58-16250812E093'. The 'Result is there?' gateway then receives the 'Scoring Level 2' and 'Scoring Level 1' tasks, leading to the 'EndEvent1'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task, which is part of the 'Wait for scoring' process, is also connected to 'EndEvent0'.
