 In a scoring system, a StartEvent0 triggers a Scoring request and sends the result to an ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway then forwards the result to EndEvent0. Meanwhile, StartEvent1 initiates a Scoring Level 1 process, which sends a list of Applications to an ExclusiveGateway2. This gateway then sends a reply to EndEvent1. The process continues with Scoring Level 2, which sends a reply to ExclusiveGateway2, and finally, the result is sent to ExclusiveGateway0. The entire process is initiated by StartEvent0 and concluded by EndEvent1.
