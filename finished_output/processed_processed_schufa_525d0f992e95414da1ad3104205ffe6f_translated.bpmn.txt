 In the scoring process, a sequence of events unfolds to ensure the accurate and timely sharing of credit scores. It begins with a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the sharing of Score Level 2 to an exclusive gateway, 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway receives the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event and initiates the scoring process.

Once the scoring process is complete, the 'Results obtained?' event is triggered, leading to the sharing of the results with 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway0'. 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the 'Score Level 2\nobtained' result to the bank, while 'ExclusiveGateway2' continues the process by sharing the Score Level 2 with the bank.

If there is a delay in obtaining the results, a 'Reporting of delay' event is triggered, which leads to the sharing of the delayed Score Level 2 with 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This event is followed by a 'perform scoring level 2' event, which continues the scoring process.

Upon obtaining the results, the 'Report scoring result Level 2 to Bank' event is triggered, leading to the sharing of the results with 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then shares the results with 'ExclusiveGateway0', which forwards the results to the bank.

Finally, the 'Score\nforwarded' event is triggered, indicating that the Score Level 1 has been successfully shared with the bank. Similarly, the 'Scoring performed' event signifies the completion of the scoring process.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of events and gateways that ensure the timely and accurate sharing of credit scores with the bank. The process begins with a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, followed by a series of events and gateways that lead to the sharing of the results with the bank.
