 Upon the initiation of shipping goods, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' to handle the insurance requirements. Concurrently, 'ParallelGateway4' is engaged to check the delivery quantity. Once the insurance is confirmed, 'ParallelGateway5' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', leading to the 'Order' event.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway6' is activated to pick up offers from three freight forwarders, and it forwards the selection to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. After the order is placed, 'ParallelGateway5' continues to work with 'ExclusiveGateway2' to fill the package note.

Parallel to this, 'ParallelGateway4' also communicates with 'ExclusiveGateway2' to verify insurance requirements. The 'Order' event then transitions to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway6' sends the selected offer to 'Packaging goods', which then connects to'sid-A06308E9-0AC1-400A-8DFD-BC5B2E235BF3' for the packaging process.

Finally, the 'Shipment of goods' event is triggered, which involves 'ParallelGateway7' and concludes the shipping process.
