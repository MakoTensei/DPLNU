 In the event of a scoring requirement, the process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers a delay report to the 'Delay\n:' gateway. This gateway then determines if the scoring is immediately available, leading to the 'Scoring immediately\navailable?' event. If the scoring is available, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway sends the scoring to the 'Scoring sent' event. Conversely, if the scoring is not immediately available, the 'Determining scoring' gateway is activated, which then sends the scoring to the 'Scoring sent' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event initiates the process by routing the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway. This gateway then determines if the scoring is available and sends it to the 'Scoring sent' event.

The process concludes with the 'Scoring supplied' event, which is the result of the 'Delay\n:' gateway determining that the scoring is available. The 'Scoring sent' event is also the result of the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway determining that the scoring is available.

In summary, the process involves the following sequence of events:

1. 'Scoring\nRequired' event triggers a delay report to the 'Delay\n:' gateway.
2. 'Delay\n:' gateway determines if the scoring is available and sends it to the 'Scoring immediately\navailable?' event.
3. 'Scoring immediately\navailable?' event determines if the scoring is available and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway determines if the scoring is available and sends it to the 'Scoring sent' event.
5. 'Scoring sent' event concludes the process, with the scoring being sent to the appropriate destination.
