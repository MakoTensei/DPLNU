 In the process flow, the system starts with the event 'Take VN to Regress?' which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. From there, 'Book payment receipt' triggers 'Regress Requirement closed'. Concurrently, 'Define Re-Preparation Time' initiated by 'Take VN to Regress?' also leads to 'Incoming payment', which in turn closes the 'Regress Requirement'. Meanwhile, 'VN makes a contradiction' sends the process to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which eventually connects to 'Inkasso Service Providers' when 'Reimbursement Time expired'. This complex process ensures that all necessary steps are taken and closed appropriately, from initiating a regress requirement to finalizing payment receipts and handling contradictions.
