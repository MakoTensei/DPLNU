 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with a start event, 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers a request for a quote. This request is then routed to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn connects to 'Request a quote'. Upon receiving the request, the quote is generated and sent back to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'Special shipment necessary?' which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This is where the process diverges based on whether a special shipment is required. If a special shipment is needed, 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to 'Filling the package note', which is then routed to 'Specialist'. The specialist handles the special shipment and sends the package note to 'EndEvent0'.

On the other hand, if no special shipment is required, 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects directly to 'EndEvent0', bypassing the 'Filling the package note' process.

Once the quote is generated, it is sent back to 'ParallelGateway5', which then connects to 'Packaging goods'. The goods are packaged and sent to 'ParallelGateway5' again.

If insurance is required, 'ParallelGateway5' connects to 'Complete insurance', which is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The insurance process is completed and the package note is sent to 'EndEvent0'.

Finally, the process concludes at 'EndEvent0', where the goods are shipped and the process is completed.
