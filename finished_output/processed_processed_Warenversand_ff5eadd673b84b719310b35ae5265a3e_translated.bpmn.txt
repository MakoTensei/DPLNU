 The process begins with the 'Goods\nOrder' event, which triggers the selection of shipping partners and the picking up of three offers. The shipping partners are selected through the 'Select shipping partners' task, which then leads to the 'Pick up 3 offers' task. The offers are picked up, and the user is prompted to select one. This selection process is facilitated by the 'Select your offer' task, which sends the user to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. From there, the user is directed to fill a standardized parcel note, which is handled by the 'Filling standardised parcel note' task.

Once the parcel note is filled, the 'Deliver goods for collection' task is initiated, which sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the goods to the 'Good quality' endpoint, completing the process.

In addition to the main process, there is an insurance option available. If the user chooses to insure the shipment, the 'Insurance?' event is triggered, leading to the 'Insurance close' task. This task sends the user to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

In summary, the process involves selecting shipping partners, picking up offers, filling a parcel note, delivering goods, and optionally insuring the shipment. The process is facilitated by various tasks and gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient flow of events.
