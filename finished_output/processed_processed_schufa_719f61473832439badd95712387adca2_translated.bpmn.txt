 In the process of scoring, when the event 'Scoring Required' is triggered, it initiates the 'perform scoring (level 1)' task, which is dependent on the 'StartEvent1'. If the scoring process is delayed, the 'Report delay of the bank' task is activated, which in turn leads to the 'Determine final scoring result' task. This task is dependent on the 'Scoring is delayed?' event. The 'Determine final scoring result' task then triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which ultimately leads to the 'EndEvent1'. This flow ensures that the scoring process is properly managed and any delays are reported and addressed accordingly.
