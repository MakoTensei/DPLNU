 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph format:

When a guest feels hungry, they trigger the event 'hunger felt' (sid-44EEF72F-274D-40C5-9064-AF4516E71F3A). This event leads to the guest adding their order, which is then processed to select their first dish from the series (sid-EFA6F663-B353-4C8B-BF78-47401E9E1A3E -> sid-1011453F-D82A-4729-930D-065A767F3D67).

Once the order is placed, the guest is handed over to the kitchen, where the 'Kitchen furniture Report' event occurs (sid-7D3A38EC-4C6D-4FF7-A658-1241FB646727). This event informs the employees about the kitchen furniture status and triggers the preparation of the meal.

After the meal is prepared, the 'rinding time in passing' event is triggered (sid-9170A4BD-4B5D-4583-A57F-F42E7FA48543), which informs the employees about the completion of the meal preparation.

The guest then receives their meal, which is labeled as 'Pieper piepst' (sid-5267019C-3AFE-4C17-8CD6-C410F0585EA2). This event leads to the guest's hunger being distilled (sid-50AA7F65-2B46-42C7-8E95-CA6C56068B17).

Finally, the guest's order is completed, and they are handed over to the guest (sid-B8EE1B0E-6761-479C-BBA4-505E
