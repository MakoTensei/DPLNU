 In the world of financial scoring, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process and deliver scoring results. Let's dive into the flow of events and tasks:

1. The process begins with a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'Message to Frontend' task. This task is responsible for communicating the need for scoring to the frontend.

2. A 'Scoring request\nmade available' event is then generated, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task. This task checks if the results for Level 1 are available and, if so, sends a 'Result Level 2 Report to Bank' message and marks the 'Scoring request\nFinished' event.

3. The 'EventBasedGateway2' task is triggered by the 'Scoring\nRequired' event. It sends a 'Scoring message\n:' message to the 'Scoring result\nthe' task and also forwards the 'Schufa delays' event to the 'InclusiveGateway3' task.

4. The 'InclusiveGateway3' task receives the 'Schufa delays' event and sends a 'Scoring result\nthe' message to the 'Scoring result\nthe' task.

5. The 'Scoring result\nthe' task, triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway2' task, sends the final scoring result to the frontend.

6. The 'Scoring request\nFinished' event is generated when the 'Results Level 1\nis there?' event is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task. This event signifies the completion of the scoring process.

In summary, the flow of events and tasks in this financial scoring process ensures that scoring requests are processed, results are generated, and the final scoring result is delivered to the frontend.
