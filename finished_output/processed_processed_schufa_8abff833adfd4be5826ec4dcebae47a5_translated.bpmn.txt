 In the scoring process, a StartEvent0 initiates the sequence. This event triggers a Scoring request, which is then caught by IntermediateCatchEvent2. The Scoring request is then sent as a Scoring value\nsend event. Meanwhile, StartEvent1 initiates a separate process where a Send a reply event is triggered. This event is caught by ExclusiveGateway0, which then sends an EndEvent2.

The Scoring value\nsend event from StartEvent0 is also caught by ExclusiveGateway0, which sends an EndEvent3. Concurrently, StartEvent0 triggers an EventBasedGateway1, which sends an EndEvent0.

In Level 1 scoring, StartEvent1 triggers an ExclusiveGateway0, which sends an EndEvent2 and an EndEvent3. The Delay\nReport event from ExclusiveGateway0 is then caught by EndEvent3.

In Level 2 scoring, StartEvent1 triggers a Send a reply event, which is caught by ExclusiveGateway0 and sends an EndEvent2. The Delay\nReport event from ExclusiveGateway0 is then caught by EndEvent3.

Lastly, StartEvent0 triggers a Note to MA event, which is caught by IntermediateCatchEvent4, sending an EndEvent1.
