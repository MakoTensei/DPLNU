 When a "Regress reported" event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various entities in the system. The process begins with the "Regress reported" event, which initiates the following sequence:

1. The "Regress reported" event is received by the "ExclusiveGateway0" (sid-77A1D3DB-5622-465D-A4AE-C2615B8F8381). This gateway is responsible for handling incoming "Regress reported" events.

2. The "ExclusiveGateway0" then forwards the event to the "Send a message" task (sid-93EB04D7-8BDB-49FC-B27C-FC026B50C03C). This task is responsible for sending a message related to the "Regress reported" event.

3. The "Send a message" task, in turn, sends a message to the "Reimbursement" task (sid-89D3099D-3B89-487A-86FF-0AC232A0023D). This task handles the reimbursement process related to the "Regress reported" event.

4. The "Reimbursement" task receives the message and sends it to the "Opposition" task (sid-2ADB01E0-8092-4AC8-8212-3FC03900F3E2). This task is responsible for handling the opposition related to the reimbursement process.

5. The "Opposition" task, upon receiving the message, sends a notification to the "Inkasso Service\nNotification" task (sid-09FD304E-92DA-4BCE-94EE-B180D7B847A0). This task is responsible for notifying the inkasso service about the opposition.

6. The "Inkasso Service\nNotification" task sends a notification to the "Close" task (sid-C0481541-AB07-4ABC-AF3
