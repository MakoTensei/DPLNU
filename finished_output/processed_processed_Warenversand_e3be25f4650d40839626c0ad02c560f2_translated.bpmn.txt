 The process begins with the 'Shipment' event, where a shipment is initiated and an inquiry is sent to Spediteur 1 through ParallelGateway0. This inquiry leads to the 'Send inquiry to Spediteur 1' task, which is then followed by the 'Offer 1' task. The offer is sent to ParallelGateway1, which in turn sends an offer to ParallelGateway2. However, ParallelGateway2 does not have any outgoing tasks, so the process continues to 'Offer 2' task, which is sent to ParallelGateway3. This leads to the 'Select your offer' task, where the specialist is selected. The specialist then sends a response through ParallelGateway3, concluding the process with the 'Goods shipped' event.
