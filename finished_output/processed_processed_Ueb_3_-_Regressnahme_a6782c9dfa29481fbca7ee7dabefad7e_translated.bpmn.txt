 When a "Regression possibility submitted" event occurs, it triggers a sequence of tasks and gateways to process the case. Here's the flow of events:

1. The "Regression possibility submitted" event initiates the process by sending a message to the "Send a message" task.
2. The "Send a message" task then forwards the case to the "ExclusiveGateway2" to determine the next steps.
3. If the case is deemed "Regression possible?", it proceeds to the "Regression possible?" gateway.
4. The "Regression possible?" gateway sends the case to either "ExclusiveGateway2" or "ExclusiveGateway3" based on the incoming events.
5. If the case is forwarded to "ExclusiveGateway2", it closes the case as "Regression case unsuccessful closed".
6. If the case is forwarded to "ExclusiveGateway3", it can either close the case as "Regression case successful closed" or forward it to the debt collection process.
7. If the case is forwarded to the debt collection process, it closes the case as "Regression case debt collection forwarded".

In summary, the "Regression possibility submitted" event triggers a series of tasks and gateways to determine the outcome of the case, which can result in either a successful closure or a forwarding to the debt collection process.
