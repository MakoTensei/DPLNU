 In a seamless workflow, the system initiates the 'Scoring Level2' process triggered by 'StartEvent1', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0' upon receiving a 'Scoring result obtained' event. Concurrently, the 'Share delay' task, also linked to 'StartEvent1', sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway0' to ensure synchronized processing. Meanwhile, 'First scoring' commences with 'StartEvent1' and awaits the 'Results available?' signal to proceed to 'Scoring Level2'. The 'Results available?' event, in turn, is activated by 'StartEvent1' and directs the flow to 'Scoring Level2' and 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Follow-up' task, associated with 'ExclusiveGateway0', is set to monitor the 'Process' outcome. Lastly, the 'Process' task, which is the culmination of the workflow, receives inputs from 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2', ensuring a comprehensive and efficient scoring system.
