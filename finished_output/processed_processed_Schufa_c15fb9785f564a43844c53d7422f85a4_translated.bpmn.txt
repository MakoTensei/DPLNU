 In the credit transfer process, a scoring request initiates the sequence. The request, identified by'sid-924A4905-BBB1-4311-A2C0-4609B7A51ECA', triggers the 'Scoring request' task, which then sends the scoring data to the 'Credit Transfer Frontend' through 'Send Scoring to Credit Transfer Frontend' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring immediately available?' gateway, identified by'sid-828ED9C8-740E-41DB-864C-BE23EDD9CDD7', checks if the scoring results are ready. If available, it completes the scoring process and sends the 'Scoring completed' event. If not, it triggers the 'Submitting delay' task, identified by'sid-C8BCFA08-ECC9-4BAA-9A8C-75550E9BCEF5', which further processes the scoring data.

Meanwhile, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, identified by'sid-C972F9BC-A1F9-4691-B98F-40F4A2D65EA0', receives the '1. perform scoring' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' tasks. It then determines the final scoring result and completes the scoring process, sending the 'Scoring completed' event.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' tasks, identified by'sid-6C2F2333-CC0A-4CB8-9C2F-69821A893A8D' and'sid-324F1D57-0C35-40BC-A582-F62FD5813B83' respectively, handle the intermediate steps in the scoring process. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, in particular, receives the 'Scoring request' and sends the 'Scoring completed' event once the scoring is done.
