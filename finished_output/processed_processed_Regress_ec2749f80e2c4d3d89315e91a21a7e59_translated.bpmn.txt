 In the process of handling potential regression requirements, the system initiates a check to determine if a regression is possible. This check is triggered by the 'Potential Regression requirement' event, which has no incoming connections but leads to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Upon identifying a potential regression, the system sends a payment request to Vietnam (VN). This request is processed through 'ParallelGateway5', which has incoming connections from 'Potential Regression requirement' and 'WV expired'. The payment request to VN results in a 'VN payment received' event, which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the payment to VN is successful, the system proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which has incoming connections from 'VN payment received' and 'WV expired'. At this point, the system checks if the objection from the United Nations (UN) is justified. If the objection is justified, the process moves to 'EndEvent1'.

If the objection is not justified, the system proceeds to 'EndEvent2', which has incoming connections from 'Possibility?' and 'EventBasedGateway4'. The system then sends a payment request to VN again, and the process continues through 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the payment to VN is not successful, the system moves to 'WV expired', which has incoming connections from 'EventBasedGateway4'. The system then checks if the objection from the UN is justified. If the objection is justified, the process moves to 'EndEvent1'.

If the objection is not justified, the system proceeds to 'EndEvent2', which has incoming connections from 'Possibility?' and 'EventBasedGateway4'. The system then sends a payment request to VN again, and the process continues through 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Finally, if the payment to VN is successful, the system reaches the 'Final completed' event, which has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'EventBasedGateway4'. This marks the completion of the process.
