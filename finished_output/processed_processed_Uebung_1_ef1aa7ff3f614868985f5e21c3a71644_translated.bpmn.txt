 The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent' (sid-604C62AB-8012-4B1B-8752-FA6DF96EE8AF), which triggers the packaging of the goods. The packaged goods then move to 'ParallelGateway7' (sid-FFCAF72B-F310-46E2-AAAA-FC3089528B9C) for further processing.

Upon arrival at 'ParallelGateway7', the system queries for the 'Shipping quantity?' (sid-1001B792-F03C-4BE4-B83B-510E52AE4971). This query is answered by 'Spediteur?' (sid-E6717BE5-34BE-482D-BE00-6A1D15561143), which determines the number of goods to be shipped.

The 'Spediteur?' query results in the engagement of 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-0D25B106-FE3B-44A8-8FE2-73C28CFAC6A9), which then forwards the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3' (sid-0D104C99D-0C70-4271-839B-446A82C85636).

The insurance inquiry leads to 'ExclusiveGateway5' (sid-D7FFD5E5-EE16-406A-9E28-A6C132827625), which processes the insurance data and sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway6
