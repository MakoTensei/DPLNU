 The process begins with the event 'Goods can be shipped', which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the insurance requirement. If the insurance is required, the process flows to 'Insurance required?' which then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2' again. If the insurance is not required, the process moves to 'Select offers' which connects to 'ParallelGateway5'.

From 'ParallelGateway5', the process can either go to 'Offer Spediteur 1', 'Offer Spediteur 2', or 'Offer Spediteur 3'. Each of these offers will then connect to 'ParallelGateway5' again.

After selecting an offer, the process moves to 'Specialist' through 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' then connects to 'ParallelGateway7' to provide a special shipping notice.

Once the special shipping notice is received, the process moves to 'Packaging goods' through 'ParallelGateway6'. After packaging, the goods are ready for collection, which is the end event.

In summary, the process starts with 'Goods can be shipped', goes through 'ExclusiveGateway2' for insurance, then to 'Select offers' and 'ParallelGateway5'. From there, it can choose between 'Offer Spediteur 1', 'Offer Spediteur 2', or 'Offer Spediteur 3'. After selecting an offer, it goes to 'Specialist' and then to 'ParallelGateway7' for a special shipping notice. Finally, the goods are packaged and ready for collection.
