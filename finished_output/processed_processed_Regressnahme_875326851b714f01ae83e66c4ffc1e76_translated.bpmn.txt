 In the case study process, when regressability occurs, the workflow is directed to ExclusiveGateway4. This gateway then leads to the closure of the internal process. Concurrently, if the process requires a resubmission, it is routed to ParallelGateway7 and ParallelGateway8, which both eventually lead to the cash receipt.

When a case study is initiated, it is also directed to ExclusiveGateway4, which subsequently closes the internal process. Additionally, if the case study necessitates a proceeding, it is routed to ExclusiveGateway4 as well, which closes the internal process.

For the process of resubmission, the workflow is directed to ParallelGateway7 and ParallelGateway8, both of which lead to the cash receipt.

The process of sending a payment request is initiated with regressability, which leads to ExclusiveGateway4. This gateway then closes the internal process and directs the workflow to Cash receipt.

When a book money receipt is received, it is routed to ExclusiveGateway5, which ultimately closes the internal process.

The process of proceedings is initiated with regressability, which leads to ExclusiveGateway4, subsequently closing the internal process.

The process begins with regressability, which leads to ExclusiveGateway4. This gateway then closes the internal process and directs the workflow to the cash receipt.

When the VN opposition occurs, the internal process is closed.

If the WV deadline is reached, the process is directed to ExclusiveGateway3, which leads to the process being transferred to collection.

In summary, the workflow starts with regressability, which leads to ExclusiveGateway4. This gateway closes the internal process and directs the workflow to various outcomes such as cash receipt, book money receipt, and process transfer to collection, depending on the specific case or event.
