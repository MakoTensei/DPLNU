In this flowchart, the process starts with the feeling of hunger, leading to selecting a court and ordering the court. Once the court is selected, the process moves to ordering food, which triggers an order report. The order report then informs the employees, who in turn inform the guest, leading to the guest's arrival.

Upon the guest's arrival, the event-based gateway is triggered, resulting in the completion of the guest's order. The process concludes with the guest's completion, followed by a lunchtime sleep.
