 In the financial services system, a scoring process is initiated when a Schufa request is obtained, triggering a sequence of events and interactions between various components.

1. The process begins with the 'Schufa request obtained' event, which is handled by the EventBasedGateway1. This gateway sends an 'EndEvent0' message to indicate the completion of the initial request handling.

2. The scoring request is then received by the 'Scoring request obtained' start event, which initiates the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task. The task's 'Score result Level 1 obtained' message is sent to the 'Score result Level 1 obtained' gateway, which in turn sends an 'EndEvent0' message to signal the completion of the first scoring level.

3. The 'Score result Level 1 obtained' gateway triggers the 'Continue score result (Level 1)' task, which sends an 'EndEvent0' message to indicate the completion of the first scoring level.

4. The 'Schufa request obtained' event also triggers the 'Report delay to Sales-MA' task, which sends an 'EndEvent0' message to indicate the completion of the delay report.

5. The 'Scoring request obtained' event also triggers the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task, which sends a 'First score result the' message to the 'First score result the' gateway. This gateway sends an 'EndEvent1' message to indicate the completion of the first scoring level and forwards the score result to the 'Score result (Level 1) back to Bank' gateway.

6. The 'Score result (Level 1) back to Bank' gateway triggers the 'Score result Level 1 obtained' task, which sends a 'Score result Level 1 obtained' message to the 'Score result Level 1 obtained' gateway. This gateway sends an 'EndEvent0' message to indicate the completion of the first scoring level.

7. The 'Schufa request obtained' event also triggers the 'Report delay to Bank' task, which sends an 'EndEvent0' message to indicate the completion of the delay report.

8. The 'Winning score will be determined?' event triggers the 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' task, which sends a 'Final scores the' message
