 When a 'Scoring request' is received, it is first forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If a 'Delay detected' event occurs, the request is rerouted to 'EventBasedGateway3'. Meanwhile, 'Conduct Level 2' is processed and eventually leads to 'EndEvent1'. If a 'Scoring request' is detected, it is immediately processed and carried out, with the outcome being 'Scoring request carried out\n'. In case of a delay, the request is also carried out after being rerouted. The 'Scoring request' is also forwarded to the 'credit award Frontend' for further processing.
