 In the process of handling a regression possibility report, the system initiates a series of tasks and interactions between different components, starting with the receipt of a "Regression possibility\nReport" and concluding with the finalization of the process.

1. The "Regression possibility\nReport" is received, triggering the "Regressability check" task. This task is directed towards "ExclusiveGateway1" and can lead to either a "Finished" state or a "Set process for resubmission" state.
