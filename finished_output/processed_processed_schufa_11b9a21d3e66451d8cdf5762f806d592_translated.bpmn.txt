 In the banking system, when a scoring request is initiated, it goes through a series of processes to ensure accurate and timely results. Here's a natural flow of events:

1. The process begins when the 'Schufascoring requested' event is triggered, which sends a request for scoring to the Schufaservice.

2. The Schufaservice then performs the level scoring and sends the 'Scoring result available' event to the banking system.

3. The banking system receives the 'Scoring result available' event and forwards the results to the Frontend.

4. If there is a delay in the scoring process, the 'Delay of scoring results' event is triggered, and the banking system sends a notification to the Frontend about the delay.

5. In case of a delay, the 'EventBasedGateway2' receives the 'Schufascoring requested' event and completes the request.

6. If the scoring is successful, the 'Scoring request completed' event is triggered, and the banking system forwards the results to the Schufa system.

7. The Schufa system then completes the request and sends a notification to the banking system.

8. If the scoring is not successful, the 'Scoring request\nBank forward' event is triggered, and the banking system forwards the request to the Schufa system.

9. The Schufa system completes the request and sends a notification to the banking system.

10. The 'Schufa request completed' event is triggered, signaling the completion of the scoring request.

This flow ensures that the scoring process is handled efficiently and that the results are communicated accurately between the banking system, Schufaservice, and the Frontend.
