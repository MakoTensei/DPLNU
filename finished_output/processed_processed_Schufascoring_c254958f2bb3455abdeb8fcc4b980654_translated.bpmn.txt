 In the scoring process, the 'Schufascoring\nenroll' event initiates the process by sending an enrollment request to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then forwards the request to 'Scoring (Level 1)' with the ID'sid-90640D10-2E89-4BA9-844E-11080DFD6BD1'. The 'Scoring (Level 1)' task, identified by'sid-85D81FB5-3901-46DE-8929-3669CB0E5A2B', receives the enrollment and generates 'Scoring result\nvalues', which are then sent to 'EndEvent0' with the ID'sid-36223907-7A36-45DB-A211-936060B527ED'.
