 When the 'News - Regress Case' event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to handle the case. First, the 'Test Regression Case' task is initiated, which sends an exclusive gateway to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Simultaneously, the 'Send payment request' task is activated, directing an incoming payment to 'Incoming payment', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. The 'EventBasedGateway5' receives the 'News - Regress Case' and routes it to 'Justified?' and 'Debt collection service provider'.

As the case progresses, the 'Book payment receipt' task is executed, leading to a closure at 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Proceedings' task also proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, the 'Debt collection service provider' task concludes with a closure.

Finally, the 'Close' event is triggered, closing the 'Book payment receipt' and 'Reimbursement period expired' tasks.
