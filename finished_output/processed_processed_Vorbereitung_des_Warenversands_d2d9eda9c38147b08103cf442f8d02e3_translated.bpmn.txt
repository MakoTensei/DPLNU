 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task leads to a decision point where the type of shipping necessary is determined. The 'What type of shipping is necessary?' gateway receives this information and directs the flow to either 'ExclusiveGateway3' or 'ParallelGateway5', depending on the shipping requirements.

If 'ExclusiveGateway3' is chosen, the process involves a specialist who will handle the shipping details. This may include discussing insurance requirements, which leads to another decision point. If insurance is deemed necessary, the process continues to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for insurance clearance. Once insurance is cleared, the process moves to 'ParallelGateway5', where the goods are packaged and prepared for collection.

Alternatively, if 'ParallelGateway5' is chosen, the goods are directly packaged and sent for collection. This pathway does not involve the specialist or insurance clearance, streamlining the process for certain shipping scenarios.

In summary, the flow of the shipping process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, leading to 'Pick up offers' and then to a decision point based on shipping requirements. Depending on the chosen pathway, the process may involve specialists and insurance clearance before the goods are packaged and sent for collection.
