 The process begins with obtaining shipping costs, which triggers the start event 'Shipping costs\nobtained'. This event leads to the '3 offers' task, which is initiated by the 'ParallelGateway4'. The '3 offers' task involves presenting three different offers to the customer. Once the customer selects an offer, the 'Select your offer' task is triggered, which is facilitated by the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Following the selection of an offer, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which requires the 'Lot?' task to be completed. The 'Lot?' task is managed by the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then connects to the 'Check insurance requirements' task. This task is necessary to determine if insurance is needed for the package.

If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which is managed by the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. After completing the insurance process, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated, which is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway4'.

Once the goods are packaged, the 'Delivering goods' task is triggered, which is managed by the 'ParallelGateway5'. This task involves delivering the goods to the customer and finalizing the shipping costs.

In summary, the process starts with obtaining shipping costs, leading to the selection of an offer, determining the need for insurance, completing the insurance process, packaging the goods, and finally delivering the goods to the customer.
