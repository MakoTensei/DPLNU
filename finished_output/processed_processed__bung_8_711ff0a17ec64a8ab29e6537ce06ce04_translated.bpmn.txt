 To describe the flow of the process in a more natural and descriptive way using names, we can create a narrative that follows the sequence of events and interactions between the system components:

1. A guest feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant.
2. The guest arrives at the restaurant and is directed to the waiting area.
3. The guest is then prompted to choose a dish from the menu.

4. Once the guest has made their selection, they proceed to the payment stage.

5. After completing the payment, the guest is handed a pieper (a fictional food item).

6. The guest is then guided to the cashier to receive their order.

7. The cashier enters the order into the cash register system and processes the payment.

8. The cashier adjusts and transfers the pieper to the appropriate location.

9. The restaurant staff informs the guest that their pieper is ready and located in the world (i.e., the kitchen).

10. The guest is notified that it's been 5 minutes since they placed their order.

11. The restaurant staff delivers the prepared pieper to the guest.

12. The guest is retrieved from the waiting area and the process is completed.

Gateways:

1. EventBasedGateway0: This gateway is responsible for handling the guest's pieper once it's located in the kitchen and for unbinding the order when the guest receives their pieper.

2. Is now in line: This gateway handles the guest's transition from feeling hungry to being in the waiting area and triggers the pieper when the guest is ready to receive their order.

3. Pieper is triggered: This gateway is responsible for notifying the restaurant staff that the pieper is ready and triggering the guest's notification that their pieper is located in the world.

4. Food is located in the world: This gateway handles the communication between the cashier and the kitchen staff, ensuring that the pieper is prepared and ready to be delivered to the guest.

5. Guest reports in the world: This gateway handles the communication between the guest and the restaurant staff, confirming that the pieper has been received
