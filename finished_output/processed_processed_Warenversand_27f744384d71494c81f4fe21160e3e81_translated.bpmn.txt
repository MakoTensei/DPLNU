 Starting with the 'Article\nShip' event, the process flows as follows:

1. The 'Article\nShip' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' with an incoming path from 'ParallelGateway5'.
2. Upon reaching 'ExclusiveGateway2', it forwards the event to 'Shipment\nprepared' with an outgoing path from 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
3. The 'Shipment\nprepared' event concludes the process with no incoming or outgoing paths.

In summary, the process starts with 'Article\nShip' at 'ParallelGateway5', which then goes through 'ExclusiveGateway2' and ends at 'Shipment\nprepared'.
