 The process begins with an 'Order to receive' event, which triggers the Secretariat to clear shipping and create a standard shipping document through ExclusiveGateway2. The Secretariat then selects the cheapest offer and requests insurance through ExclusiveGateway3. Once the goods are packaged, ParallelGateway4 is used to send them to ExclusiveGateway2 for processing. The goods are then sent to ExclusiveGateway2, which sends them to ParallelGateway5. Finally, the goods are ready for collection and sent out through ParallelGateway5, completing the process.
