 Starting with the 'Explanation' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Explanation' event triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which has incoming connections to 'ParallelGateway3'.

2. The 'Packaging goods' task then leads to the 'ParallelGateway3' task, which has an outgoing connection to 'Shipping'.

3. The 'Shipping' task, in turn, has an incoming connection from 'Packaging goods', completing the process.


In summary, the 'Explanation' event initiates the packaging of goods, which are then shipped, resulting in the 'Shipping' event.
