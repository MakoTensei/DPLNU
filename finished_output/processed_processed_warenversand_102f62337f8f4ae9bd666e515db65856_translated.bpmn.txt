 When a product is ordered, the process begins with a request for three freight forwarders, which is handled by sid-EC7101C8-7BEB-4A57-AE2B-416EA51B1BB9. The product then goes through the filling of a standardized parcel note, managed by sid-D5D435BE-BFD1-4783-ABB9-97BA53F85BE1, and a request for cheap offers is made, directed to sid-9FF02501-5F4E-4A2E-827C-F202146C4188.

Once a cheap offer is chosen, the process moves to sid-2C6C1384-204B-4F34-B65A-6F17AA921258, which acts as a specialist. The specialist then directs the product to ExclusiveGateway3, which is connected to sid-A5EA3006-17A3-474F-B6C6-358195363B66, responsible for packaging the goods.

After packaging, the goods are provided for collection at ExclusiveGateway5, managed by sid-6E1D2440-0101-442F-8231-5EAAD6E065D8. The process concludes with the goods being sent, handled by sid-B1A22CAE-DBFD-4E2B-B117-C47D6B0CA56C, which is the endpoint of the process.
