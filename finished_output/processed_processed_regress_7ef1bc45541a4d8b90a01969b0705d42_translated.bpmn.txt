 Upon receiving a regression report, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. First, the 'Check regression' task is triggered, which sends a request to ExclusiveGateway2. If the regression is confirmed, the 'Set process for resubmission' task is activated, leading to a deadline expiration event that transitions to 'Subject matter'. Conversely, if the regression is not confirmed, the 'Send payment request to VN' task is executed, which also routes to ExclusiveGateway2.

Simultaneously, the 'Proceedings' task is initiated when VN contradicts the report, sending it to ExclusiveGateway3. Meanwhile, the 'Get money' task is triggered, which, upon receiving a regression report, sends the request to Close.

The 'Dispense process to Inkasso-DL' task is activated when IntermediateCatchEvent4 occurs, directing the process to the subject matter.

The system concludes with the 'Finished' event, which is reached through the 'Proceedings' task or the 'Subject matter' event, depending on the preceding tasks' outcomes.
