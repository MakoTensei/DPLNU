 The workflow begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'Filling standard package tickets' task, utilizing 'ParallelGateway4' as an incoming connection. This task is followed by the 'Check order quantity' task, which also uses 'ParallelGateway4' as an incoming connection and sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Pick up offers' task then takes the 'Quantity' from 'ParallelGateway4' as an incoming connection and sends its output to 'Selection of freight forwarders'. The 'Complete insurance' task, triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' question, uses 'ParallelGateway4' as an incoming connection and sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Goods delivered' task, which uses 'ParallelGateway5' as an incoming connection, sends its output to 'Goods shipped'. The 'Selection of freight forwarders' task, which uses 'Quantity' as an incoming connection, sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Lastly, the 'Packaging goods' task, which uses 'ParallelGateway4' as an incoming connection, sends its output to 'ParallelGateway5'. The workflow concludes with the 'Goods shipped' event, which receives input from 'Insurance necessary?' and has no outgoing connections.
