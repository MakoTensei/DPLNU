The 'Specialist' then connects to the 'Big crowd?' gateway, which in turn directs the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. From there, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which sends the package note to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Provide for collection' task is then executed, concluding the process at the 'EndEvent0'.

In parallel, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Determine sender' task, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task then leads to the 'Packing' task, which sends the package to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then connects to the 'EndEvent0', completing the process.

The 'Choose your favorite' task also connects to the 'Insurance?' task, which is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' gateway. The 'Insurance?' task sends the package to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

Lastly, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' gateway, which sends the package note to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then connects to the 'EndEvent0', completing the process.
