 Let's start with the event where a "Regression possibility Report" is initiated, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions with various gateways:

1. A "Regression possibility Report" is received, prompting the system to send a message to the team to check the case.

2. The message is sent, and the system then checks if the regression is possible.

3. If the regression is possible, the system proceeds to set up a "WV" (which could stand for "Working Verification" or similar) and sends a "Money Report" to the finance team.

4. The finance team processes the "Money Report" and closes the case with a "Process with cash receipt closed" outcome.

5. If the regression is not possible, the system forwards the case to another team.

6. If the opposition obtains the case, the system closes the case as unsuccessful.

7. If the "WV" expires, the case is forwarded to another team.


Here's a more natural flow description:

1. A "Regression possibility Report" is received, prompting the system to send a message to the team to check the case.

2. The team checks the case and determines if a regression is possible.

3. If a regression is possible, the system sets up a "WV" and sends a "Money Report" to the finance team.

4. The finance team processes the "Money Report" and closes the case with a "Process with cash receipt closed" outcome.

5. If a regression is not possible, the system forwards the case to another team.

6. If the opposition obtains the case, the system closes the case as unsuccessful.

7. If the "WV" expires, the system forwards the case to another team.


This flow ensures that the case is handled efficiently, with appropriate actions taken based on the regression possibility and other factors.
