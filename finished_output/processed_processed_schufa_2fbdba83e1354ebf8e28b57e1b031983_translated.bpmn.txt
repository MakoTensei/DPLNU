 In a scoring system, the process begins with a 'Scoring Required' event that triggers the 'Scoring Request' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This request is then forwarded to the 'Scoring' task, which generates the 'Scoring Result to Frontend' message. The 'Scoring Result to Frontend' message is then sent to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which in turn sends the message to 'EndEvent1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Request' also triggers a 'Level 1 Scoring Before Yes/No' task, which sends the 'Scoring for Customer XY Required' message to 'Level 1 Scoring Before Yes/No'. This task is then forwarded to 'EndEvent3'.

The 'Scoring Result to Frontend' message is also sent to the 'Level 2 Scoring Perform' task, which generates the 'Final Scoring Result' message. This message is then sent to 'EndEvent3'.

Finally, the 'Scoring Request' triggers the 'Scoring Ends' event, which sends the 'Scoring Ends' message to 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent3'. The 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent3' are the final events in the scoring process.
