 The process begins with an 'Order the' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to 'Select offers'. The 'Select offers' task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then connects to 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' task is followed by 'ParallelGateway5', which finally leads to the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Order the' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which connects to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Meanwhile, the 'Pick up offers' task is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Lastly, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' event, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the process involves several tasks and gateways, starting with 'Order the' and ending with 'Goods ready for dispatch'. The tasks and gateways are interconnected, ensuring a smooth flow of operations from order placement to dispatch.
