 When shipping goods, the process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Lot?' event to determine the specific items being shipped. This leads to the 'Provide for collection' task, where the necessary collection details are gathered. The 'Insurance necessary?' event is also triggered, connecting to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to decide if insurance is required.

If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Insurance close' task is initiated, which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' to finalize the insurance process. Concurrently, the 'Filling the package note' task is executed, which requires the 'Lot?' event to provide the necessary details.

Once the insurance is closed, the 'Goods shipped' event is triggered, and the 'Insurance close' task is completed. The 'Shipyard' task is also initiated, which requires the 'Lot?' event to determine the specific items being shipped.

Throughout this process, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' serves as a central hub, connecting various tasks and events, ensuring a smooth and efficient flow of goods from shipping to collection and insurance.
