 Upon receiving a 'Regress reported' event, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. First, the 'Check regression' task is triggered, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the regression is confirmed, the 'Regress edited' task is executed, which can be routed to either 'Objection justified?' or 'ExclusiveGateway3', depending on the outcome of the 'Regress possible?' gateway.


If the 'Regress possible?' gateway determines that a regress is indeed possible, the 'Regress edited' task is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Concurrently, the 'Send payment request to VN' task is activated, which sends a payment request to Vietnam.


If the 'Regress possible?' gateway concludes that the reported regression is not justified, the 'Regress edited' task is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then routes the task to 'Regress edited' again, which can be directed to 'Notification' or 'at debt collection office\nthey are', depending on the specific circumstances.


In the case of a 'Reimbursement period expired' event, the 'Regress edited' task is also triggered, which can be routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle the revised reimbursement process.


This flow ensures that any reported regression is thoroughly investigated and appropriately managed, with clear pathways for different outcomes and necessary follow-up actions.
