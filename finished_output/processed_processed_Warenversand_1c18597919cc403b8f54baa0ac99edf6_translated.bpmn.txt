 The process begins with the 'Goods stands for shipping ready' event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. This task requires the 'ParallelGateway4' to handle its incoming and outgoing tasks. Once the goods are packaged, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is initiated, which also uses 'ParallelGateway4' for its operations.

Simultaneously, the 'Insurance necessary?' event is triggered, which leads to the 'Complete insurance' task. This task also utilizes 'ParallelGateway4' for its incoming and outgoing tasks. The 'Complete insurance' task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'Need to clarify insurance' task is triggered by the 'Good big?' event, which also uses 'ParallelGateway4'. This task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which eventually leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Select your offer' task is initiated by the 'Good big?' event and uses 'ParallelGateway4'. This task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which also leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

Lastly, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by the 'Good big?' event and uses 'ParallelGateway5'. This task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which eventually leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process involves various tasks and gateways, all interconnected to ensure the smooth handling of goods, insurance, and collection processes.
