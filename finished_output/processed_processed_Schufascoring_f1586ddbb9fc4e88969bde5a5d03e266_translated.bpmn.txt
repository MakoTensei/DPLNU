 In the scoring process, a question is obtained, triggering a forward query to Schufascoring, which immediately determines the scoring result. This result is then forwarded to an exclusive gateway, where it is determined to be available. The immediate result is then sent to an event-based gateway, which determines the scoring result after conducting level 1 scoring. The final scoring result is determined after more scoring at level 2.
