 To describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph, we can follow the sequence of tasks and interactions between the system components and events. Here's a descriptive flow:

1. The process begins with the event 'Hunger', which triggers the system to call the customer.
2. The customer places an order, which is received by the system and triggers the 'Order to receive' event.
3. The system then triggers the 'Trigger Pieper' event to process the order.
4. The 'inform employees' event is triggered to notify the employees about the new order.
5. The employees prepare the meal, which is represented by the 'Eat meal' event.
6. Once the meal is ready, the 'Mealing in Average' event is triggered, and the meal is handed over to the customer.
7. The 'Order completely processed' event is triggered, indicating that the order has been successfully processed.

This flow can be represented in a single flowchart as follows:

```
