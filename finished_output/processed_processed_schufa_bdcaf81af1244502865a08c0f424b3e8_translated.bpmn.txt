 In the process of scoring, a Schufascoring request is initiated, which triggers a StartEvent1. This request is then received and processed by ExclusiveGateway0, leading to the determination of the scoring result. The scoring result is then passed through ParallelGateway1, where it is made available as EndEvent3. However, if there are any delays in the scoring process, an IntermediateCatchEvent2 is triggered, which eventually leads to EndEvent1. The entire process concludes with EndEvent2, signifying the completion of the scoring process.
