 In the case of a regression, the workflow begins with the 'Regression' start event, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task. This task is dependent on the 'Regression' event and has no incoming tasks. Once the 'Send payment request' task is completed, it leads to the 'WVL set' task, which is dependent on the 'Send payment request' task and has 'Cash receipt' as its incoming task.

The 'WVL set' task, in turn, triggers the 'Close the case' task, which is dependent on the 'WVL set' task and has 'Cash receipt' as its incoming task. This task can also be triggered by the 'Opposition' start event, which is dependent on the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task and has 'Close the case' as its outgoing task.

When the 'Close the case' task is completed, it leads to the 'EndEvent0' task, which is dependent on the 'Regress?' event and has no outgoing tasks. Similarly, the 'Close the case' task can also lead to the 'EndEvent1' task, which is dependent on the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task and has 'Cash receipt' as its incoming task.

The 'justified?' event, triggered by the 'Opposition' start event, leads to the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3' tasks, which are dependent on the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task and have 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3' as their outgoing tasks, respectively.

In summary, the workflow for handling a regression case involves the following tasks:

1. Start with the 'Regression' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task.
2. The 'Send payment request' task leads to the 'WVL set' task, which triggers the 'Close the case' task.
3. The 'Close the case' task can be triggered by the 'Opposition' event, which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', 'EndEvent2', and 'EndEvent3' tasks.
4. The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' tasks have no outgoing tasks, while the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3
