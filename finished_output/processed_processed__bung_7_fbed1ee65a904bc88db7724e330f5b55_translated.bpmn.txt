 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nRequest\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'View Level 2 scoring' task, sending the inquiry to the ExclusiveGateway2. Concurrently, another 'Schufascoring\nRequest\nobtained' event also initiates the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, forwarding the request.

Once the 'Level 2 scoring\nobtained' task is completed, the 'Result\nsent' event is triggered, indicating that the result has been sent. Meanwhile, the 'Level 1\navailable?' event, which was triggered by the 'Schufascoring\nRequest\nobtained' event, leads to the 'Information\nGranted' event, confirming the availability of Level 1 scoring.

In case the Level 1 scoring is not available, the 'Schufascoring\nRequest\nobtained' event triggers the 'Report delay' task, indicating a delay in the process.

The process concludes with the 'Information\nGranted' event, which is triggered by the 'Level 1\navailable?' event, signifying the successful completion of the inquiry process.
