 In the workflow, the process begins with the event 'VN may. taken in Regress they are' (sid-C8ACB436-E303-45CE-A99C-76CA0CD98B3F). This event triggers a check for regression, which is assigned the task 'Check regression' (sid-AC7DEB9D-CEB3-4336-B754-33204E7F11B9). The task has two outgoing connections: one to 'Possibility?' (sid-95568E1A-8C3A-41B9-BD5E-85ECA99DE6E8) and another to 'Close' (sid-68D7F6F6-BB2B-4995-BF5D-2A5CDB7D1C84).

The 'Possibility?' gateway (sid-E63E7C9D-BAF9-48F5-BE9F-2175F4EFEE11) receives the incoming connection from 'Check regression' and sends two outgoing connections: 'Closed' and 'Closed'.

The 'Close' task (sid-68D7F6F6-BB2B-4995-BF5D-2A5CDB7D1C84) is triggered by the 'Possibility?' gateway and closes the process.

Meanwhile, the 'Check regression' task (sid-AC7DEB9D-CEB3-4336-B754-33204E7F11B9) also has an incoming connection from 'VN payment request' (sid-B9CE1472-0928-4FED-86F3-A852DF6527A2). This triggers the 'VN payment request' task (sid-B9CE1472-0928-4FED-86F3-A852DF6527A2), which has two outgoing connections: '
