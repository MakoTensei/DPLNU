 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with determining the scale of the shipment at ParallelGateway7, which may lead to a special shipment if necessary. If a special shipment is required, the system will request the cheapest offer from the available forwarders. Concurrently, the packaging of goods commences at ParallelGateway7, with the outcome being the goods ready for collection at ParallelGateway4.


As the goods are packaged, the system also fills the package note at ParallelGateway5. If insurance is deemed necessary, the process will proceed to the Insurance Close at ExclusiveGateway1.


Once the goods are packaged and the insurance is determined, the system will provide the goods for collection at ParallelGateway6. If a special shipment was required, the system will then choose the cheapest offer, which leads to the involvement of the Specialist at ExclusiveGateway1.


The Specialist will then handle the special shipment, and the goods will be ready for collection at ParallelGateway6. The process concludes with the goods being ready for collection, signifying the end of the workflow.
