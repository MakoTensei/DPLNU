 In this system, we have several tasks and gateways that interact with each other to handle different scenarios. Here's a natural flow description of the system:

1. When a "Regress request" is received, it triggers the "Regress? Gateway" (sid-E3BF3B35-9590-40FC-BD8E-26AF94C102E4). This gateway has two outgoing paths: "Send payment request" (sid-FA345BAF-3B4C-465B-878A-3B27DAB161D8) and "EndEvent3" (sid-96A1AA71-8002-4110-9A8E-0F06738E67BA).

2. If the "Regress request" leads to the "Send payment request" path, the system will book a case (sid-F72AE05B-BB4B-40DB-9AC7-C2E61137B264) and close it (sid-ECB5C07A-E993-47AF-BDBB-B3DE70D39546).

3. If the "Regress request" leads to the "EndEvent3" path, the system will close the case (sid-4A75B69D-864D-40C1-868B-40D6A1F12B6C).

4. When a "Regress request" is received, it also triggers the "On reproach" task (sid-4A75B69D-864D-40C1-868B-40D6A1F12B6C). This task has two outgoing paths: "Testing" (sid-47AC7EC4-DFF4-425F-B3B0-DA03DCC12E29) and "10 days" (sid-CC791F64-C536-4B2
