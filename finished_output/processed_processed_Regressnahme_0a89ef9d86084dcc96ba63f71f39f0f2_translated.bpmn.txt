 When a report on regression is received, the system checks if a regress is possible through the 'Regress possible?' gateway. If the regress is possible, a message is sent to the Inkasso service provider. Following this, the 'Cash receipt' gateway processes the reimbursement, and the 'Book money receipt' gateway records the transaction. The 'VN' gateway then proceeds to the 'Message to Inkasso service provider' event, which is triggered by the 'Proceedings' event and the 'EventBasedGateway2' event. Finally, the 'Process' event concludes the workflow, handling the necessary steps for the regress and reimbursement.
