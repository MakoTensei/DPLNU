 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the pickup of offers, which is then handled by the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway directs the task to 'Filling the package note', which in turn sends an incoming signal to 'StartEvent0'. The 'Insurance notwending?' event is triggered by 'ParallelGateway2', leading to the 'Select Speditur' task, which is also managed by 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Order Speditur' task is then activated, sending an outgoing signal to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Insurance close' event, triggered by 'Insurance notwending?', also sends an outgoing signal to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Packaging goods' task is initiated by 'ParallelGateway2', which sends an outgoing signal to 'ParallelGateway3'. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway3', which sends an outgoing signal to 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.
