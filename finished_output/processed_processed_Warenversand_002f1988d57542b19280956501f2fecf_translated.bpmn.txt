 In a complex logistics system, various tasks and events are interconnected through exclusive and inclusive gateways. Here's a natural flow description of the system:

1. The process starts with 'Start 1' event, which triggers 'Task 1'. This task sends 'large\nQuantities' to 'Select your offer' event and also sends 'EndEvent0' to 'Task 1'.

2. 'Select your offer' event receives 'large\nQuantities' and sends 'EndEvent1' to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

3. 'Task 1' sends 'EndEvent0' to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends 'EndEvent1' to 'Task 1'.

4. 'Task 2' receives 'Start 1' and sends 'Packaging goods' to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

5. 'ExclusiveGateway4' receives 'Select your offer', 'Insurance\nnecessary', and 'Filling standard package voucher' and sends 'InclusiveGateway5'.

6. 'InclusiveGateway5' receives 'large\nQuantities' and 'Packaging goods' and sends 'EndEvent1'.

7. 'Goods for shipping' event receives 'StartEvent1' and sends 'large\nQuantities' to 'Select your offer' and 'EndEvent1'.

8. 'Secretariat:\n3 offers' event receives 'StartEvent1' and sends 'Select your offer' to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

9. 'Specialist' receives 'Select your offer' and sends 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

10. 'Postal mail' event receives 'large\nQuantities' and sends 'Filling standard package voucher' to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

11. 'Delivery of the goods for collection' event receives 'InclusiveGateway5' and sends 'EndEvent1'.

This interconnected system ensures that tasks and events are executed in a specific order, with data flowing through gateways to reach the desired outcomes.
