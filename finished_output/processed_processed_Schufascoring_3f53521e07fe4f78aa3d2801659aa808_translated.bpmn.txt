 In the scoring system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring, Level 1, perform' task. This task is dependent on the 'Scoring, Level 1, available?' task, which is managed by the 'Scoring, Level 1, available?' gateway. Once the 'Scoring, Level 1, perform' task is completed, it triggers the 'Scoring, Level 2, perform' task. This task is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway1' which in turn is triggered by the 'StartEvent1'. The 'Scoring, Level 2' task is then managed by the 'Scoring, Level 2' gateway. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent1' which is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway1'. The 'EndEvent0' is triggered by the 'Scoring, Level 1, available?' gateway, and the 'Scoring, Level 1' task is managed by the 'Scoring, Level 1' gateway. The 'Delay notification' task is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway1' and manages the 'EndEvent1'.
