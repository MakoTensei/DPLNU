 In the system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Initialize Schufascorings' task, leading to the generation of a 'Scoring result'. This result then initiates the 'Scoring' task, which upon completion, results in a 'Scoring completed' event. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Two. Report scoring' task, which is executed four times, each time resulting in a 'Scoring completed' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Schufa n question' task is triggered, leading to the 'Two. perform scoring' task. This task is then followed by the 'Schufa request carried out' task, which is triggered by both the 'Delay' and 'Results available' gateways.

The 'Delay' gateway, triggered by 'StartEvent0', results in the 'Report delay' event. Additionally, the 'EventBasedGateway2' triggers the 'Scoring completed' and 'Report deferral' events. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' event is also triggered by 'StartEvent0', resulting in a 'Scoring completed' event.

In summary, the system initiates the scoring process with 'StartEvent0', which triggers multiple tasks and gateways, leading to the generation of various events and the completion of the scoring process.
