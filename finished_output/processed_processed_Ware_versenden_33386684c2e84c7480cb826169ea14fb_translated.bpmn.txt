 In the process of shipping goods, the workflow begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'StartEvent1' and initiates the creation of a quote. The goods then proceed to 'ParallelGateway4', where the 'Select the Spediteur' task is executed, and the 'Specialist' is chosen to handle the shipment. The 'Filling the package note' task follows, with the 'ExclusiveGateway2' receiving the package note and sending it to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Packaging goods' task is also initiated at 'ParallelGateway4', leading to the 'ParallelGateway5' where the goods are prepared for delivery.

Once the goods are packaged, they are sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1' for the 'Complete insurance' task, ensuring they are covered during transit. The goods then move to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for the 'Filling the package note' task, which is completed and sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' at 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the package note and proceeds to the 'Delivering goods' task, which is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway5'.

Upon successful delivery, the 'Goods delivered' event is triggered, and the 'EndEvent1' concludes the quote creation process. Throughout this workflow, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway1' play crucial roles in ensuring the goods are insured and delivered, respectively.
