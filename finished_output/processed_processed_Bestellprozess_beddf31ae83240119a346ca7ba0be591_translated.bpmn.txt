 The process begins with the task of determining the quantity of goods, which is triggered by the arrival of goods at ParallelGateway3. This task then proceeds to ExclusiveGateway0, which subsequently directs the process to Select your offer. The offer selection process is facilitated by ExclusiveGateway2, which then leads to the Specialist. The Specialist, upon receiving the goods at ExclusiveGateway0, moves the process to ExclusiveGateway2.

Once the offer is selected, the process moves to Filling the package note at ExclusiveGateway0, which then determines whether an insurance is necessary. If insurance is required, the process proceeds to Complete insurance at ExclusiveGateway1, which then directs the process to ExclusiveGateway2.

After the insurance is determined, the process moves to Packaging goods at ParallelGateway3, which then sends the goods to ParallelGateway4. Finally, the process concludes with the provision for collection at ParallelGateway4, which leads to the EndEvent0.

In summary, the process starts with the arrival of goods at ParallelGateway3, which triggers the determination of quantity. This leads to a series of tasks involving offer selection, insurance determination, and packaging, all of which are managed by ExclusiveGateway2 and ParallelGateway4. The process concludes with the provision for collection at ParallelGateway4, marking the end of the process.
