 In the logistics process, a shipment is required, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways. The shipment process begins with the 'Shipment required' event, which initiates the packaging of goods at 'ParallelGateway4'. The packaged goods then move to 'ParallelGateway5' for insurance verification. If insurance is necessary, the process diverges to 'Check insurance requirements' at 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, which subsequently connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, the goods are also prepared for delivery at 'Ready goods' task, which requires the goods to be delivered.


Once the insurance is verified, the goods are deemed ready for delivery, and the 'Ready goods' task sends the goods to 'Goods delivered' at 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Meanwhile, the 'Packaging goods' task at 'ParallelGateway4' also sends the packaged goods to '3 offers' at 'ParallelGateway5', where customers can select their preferred offer.


The '3 offers' task sends the selected offer to 'Select your offer' at 'ParallelGateway5', which then connects to 'Specialist' at 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Filling parcel note' task at 'ParallelGateway4' sends the lot details to 'Check insurance requirements' at 'Insurance necessary?', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.


Finally, the 'Check insurance requirements' task at 'ParallelGateway4' sends the lot details to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then connects to 'ParallelGateway5' to deliver the goods. The entire process concludes with the 'Goods delivered' event, where the goods are successfully delivered to the customer.
