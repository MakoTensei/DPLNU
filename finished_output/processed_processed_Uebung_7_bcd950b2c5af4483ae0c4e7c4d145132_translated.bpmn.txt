 In a system designed to handle search events and scoring, the following tasks and gateways are interconnected to process and report the results:

1. When a 'Start your search' event occurs, it triggers a 'forward delay message' task. This task initiates the search process and waits for the results.

2. Upon receiving a 'Scoring 1 result received' message, the 'Scoring 1 result forward' task is triggered. This task performs the scoring for the first result and sends a 'Scoring 1 performed' message to the 'Is the result?' gateway.

3. The 'Is the result?' gateway, with an ID of'sid-C7AE34E9-3DB4-4757-843B-8BC14FBFB099', receives the 'Scoring 1 performed' message. It then sends a 'Scoring 2 carried out' message to the 'Scoring 2' task and a 'Scoring performed' message to the 'Scoring 1 performed' task.

4. If a 'Scoring 2 results received' message is received by the 'Scoring 2 results received' task, it triggers the 'Scoring 2 result forward' task. This task performs the scoring for the second result and sends a 'Scoring 2' message to the 'Scoring 2 carried out' gateway.

5. The 'Scoring 2 carried out' gateway, with an ID of'sid-6C6B039E-EDC3-4D77-9A45-B5FA54AEAE6B', receives the 'Scoring 2' message. It then sends a 'Scoring 2 carried out' message to the 'Scoring 2 carried out' task and a 'Scoring carried out' message to the 'Scoring 1 performed' task.

6. The 'Scoring 2 carried out' task, with an ID of'sid-BA7DB6C2-C36E-4391-AD71-AFB06A172E79', is the final step in the process. It reports the completion of
