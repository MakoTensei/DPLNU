 In a bustling court of justice, a famine event triggers a series of interconnected tasks and events. The court's system initiates a process to address the famine, leading to a series of actions involving the Court of Justice, an Order to give up, Payment, and Payment in guest.

The Court of Justice, upon receiving the famine event, selects the appropriate course of action and sends the order to the guest. The guest, in turn, prepares a meal in the Enriched theater. Once the meal is ready, the Cook reports the completion of the meals, concluding the series of events.

Meanwhile, the Order to give up is triggered by the series event, leading to a Payment task. The Payment task, in turn, connects to the guest, who then prepares a meal in the Enriched theater.

The Payment in guest task is completed when the Cook reports the finished meals, which marks the end of the series of events.

In parallel, the court's system also handles the food preparation process. A StartEvent1 initiates the process, leading to the Food is ready event. Once the food is ready, the EndEvent0 concludes the process.

Simultaneously, a StartEvent2 event triggers the Order Cook task, which is followed by the Cook Report Meals Finished event, marking the end of the series of events.

Lastly, a StartEvent3 event initiates a guest-related process, which concludes with the EndEvent1 event.

Overall, the court of justice and the food preparation system work together to address the famine and ensure that the guests are well-fed and satisfied.
