 In the workflow, we have several tasks and gateways that handle the process of scoring and inquiries to Schufa. Here's a natural flow description of the system:

1. The process starts with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'forward scoring' task. This task is responsible for initiating the scoring process.

2. The 'forward scoring' task sends an 'incoming' message to the 'EventBasedGateway2' task. This gateway is responsible for handling the 'Scoring\nRequired' event and directing the flow to the 'level 1 scoring' task.

3. The 'level 1 scoring' task processes the scoring and sends a'scoring 1 result' message to the'scoring 1 result' task.

4. The'scoring 1 result' task sends an 'incoming' message to the'scoringergenmis is fixed?' gateway. This gateway checks if the issue with'scoringergenmis' is resolved.

5. If'scoringergenmis' is fixed, the gateway sends a 'forward delay' task to the 'forward scoring' task. This task handles the 'Scoring\nRequired' event and directs the flow to the'scoring 2 result' task.

6. The'scoring 2 result' task processes the second level of scoring and sends a'scoring 2 finished' message to the'scoring 2 finished' task.

7. The'scoring 2 finished' task sends an 'incoming' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task. This gateway checks if the'scoringergenmis' issue is fixed and directs the flow to the 'EndEvent2' task.

8. The 'EndEvent2' task marks the end of the process and sends an 'outgoing' message to the 'ergenis return' task.

9. The 'ergenis return' task sends an 'incoming' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which checks if the'scoringergenmis' issue is fixed and directs the flow to the 'EndEvent2' task.

10. The 'EndEvent2' task marks the end of the
