 When Hunger strikes, the Court of Justice is summoned to address the need for sustenance. The Court, in turn, places an order to receive a meal. This order triggers a series of events:

1. The order to receive a meal is communicated to the Koch, who then informs the guests about the meal's readiness.
2. The meal is prepared and ready to be picked up.
3. The guests are notified that the meal is ready and they have 5 minutes to collect it.
4. The guests arrive at the Court, and the Pieper is restarted to serve the meal.
5. Once the meal is served, the guests are satisfied, and the Pieper is put to rest.
6. The meal is provided to the guests, and the process concludes.
