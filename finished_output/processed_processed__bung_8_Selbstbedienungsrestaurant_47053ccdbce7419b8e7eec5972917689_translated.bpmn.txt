 Let's describe the flow of the process in a more natural and conversational flow:

1. When you feel hungry, you can visit a restaurant to choose your meal.
2. Once you've made your choice, you can add your order to the menu.
3. After placing your order, you'll be asked to pay for your meal.
4. The restaurant will then prepare your meal.
5. Once your meal is ready, you'll be notified and can collect your food.
6. After collecting your food, you'll be able to enjoy your meal.
7. When you're done eating, you can notify the restaurant staff, and they will inform the employees about the completed order.
8. The restaurant staff will then clean up and close the restaurant for the day.

In terms of the system flow, the process can be described as follows:

1. The process starts when a customer feels hungry and triggers the "Feeling hungry" event.
2. The customer then visits the restaurant and chooses their meal, triggering the "Visit restaurant" event.
3. The customer adds their order to the menu, triggering the "Add your order" event.
4. The customer pays for their meal, triggering the "Pay money" event.
5. The restaurant prepares the meal, triggering the "Prepare meal" event.
6. The customer collects their food, triggering the "Collect food" event.
7. The customer eats their meal, triggering the "Eat meal" event.
8. After finishing their meal, the customer notifies the restaurant staff, triggering the "Notify staff" event.
9. The restaurant staff informs the employees about the completed order, triggering the "Inform employees" event.
10. The restaurant staff cleans up and closes the restaurant, triggering the "EndEvent1" event.
