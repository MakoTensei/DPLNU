 In the logistics workflow, the Secretariat first checks the shipping method, which can be done through ExclusiveGateway3 or Filling standard package voucher, depending on the type of shipping selected. Once the shipping method is determined, the logistics managers proceed to insure the goods if necessary, with options to either Insuring goods by logistics managers or ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway4 serves as the initial gateway for various tasks, such as checking the shipping method, filling standard package vouchers, insuring goods, and preparing shipments. It also connects to ExclusiveGateway2 and ExclusiveGateway3, which handle specific tasks like selecting the shipping carrier and packing goods for collection.

The process begins with the 'Shipment is to prepare' event, which triggers the Secretariat to check the shipping method through ExclusiveGateway2. Following this, the logistics managers can decide whether to insure the goods or not, leading to either Insuring goods by logistics managers or ExclusiveGateway2.

After the shipping method and insurance decisions are made, the goods are prepared for shipment. The 'ParallelGateway4' gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway5' for the goods to be made available for collection.

In summary, the workflow involves the Secretariat checking the shipping method, logistics managers deciding on insurance, and the goods being prepared for shipment and made available for collection.
