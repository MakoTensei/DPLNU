 When a scoring request is initiated for Schufa, the process begins with the 'Schufascoring request started' event, which triggers the 'Scoring delays' gateway. This gateway then sends the request to the 'Start Level 1' event, where the scoring process commences. If the scoring takes place, the 'Scoring immediately' event is triggered, and the process is completed. However, if there are delays, the process moves to 'Start Level 2', where the 'Level 2 Share result' event is triggered upon completion. Throughout this process, various intermediate events and gateways, such as 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'EventBasedGateway1', ensure the smooth flow of the scoring request.
