 In the shipping process, the 'Send a message' task initiates the process by routing the message to 'ParallelGateway4', which then triggers 'Clearing the shipping mode' to prepare the shipment for transit. Concurrently, 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the message and assigns a 'Spediteur' to handle the forwarding of goods. This assignment leads to the creation of a 'package ticket' at 'ParallelGateway5'. Meanwhile, 'InclusiveGateway2' receives the package ticket and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn provides the 'Provision of goods'. The goods are then packaged at 'ParallelGateway5' and sent to 'InclusiveGateway3' for final processing. Once the goods are ready, they are provisioned through 'ExclusiveGateway0' and the process concludes with the 'Provision of goods' task.
