 In the logistics process, the following tasks are carried out:

1. A special shipment is determined to be necessary, which triggers the 'StartEvent0' and leads to the 'Insurance necessary?' and 'Pick up offers' gates.

2. The 'Insurance necessary?' gate, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway4' and 'EndEvent0'.

3. The 'Pick up offers' gate, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gate, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'Choose from 1', 'ExclusiveGateway3', and 'ExclusiveGateway3' gates.

5. The 'Choose from 1' gate, triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2', leads to the 'Specialist' gate.

6. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gate, triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2', leads to the 'Specialist' gate.

7. The 'Specialist' gate, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'ParallelGateway6'.

8. The 'Packaging goods' gate, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'ParallelGateway6'.

9. The 'Filling the package note' gate, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'ParallelGateway6'.

10. The 'ParallelGateway6' gate, triggered by 'Filling the package note', 'Packaging goods', and 'StartEvent0', leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

11. The 'EndEvent0' gate, triggered by 'ParallelGateway5', leads to the end of the process.
