 In the process of handling a regression test request, the following sequence of events unfolds:

1. A regression test request is initiated due to suspected issues ('Regression the suspected').
2. This triggers a Payment on Send request to ensure the necessary funds are available for the process ('Payment on Send request').
3. The Payment on Send request leads to the creation of a recovery template in case of any payment-related issues ('Creating a recovery template').
4. The recovery template is then used to proceed with the process ('Proceedings').
5. The process is completed once the Opposition Right? event is triggered, confirming the resolution of the issue ('Opposition Right?').
6. Finally, the case is closed, marking the end of the process ('Case completed').

Throughout this process, various events and gateways are involved, such as Regress Requirements, Exclusive Gateway4, and EndEvent2. The process starts with the Regression the suspected event and ends with the Case completed event.
