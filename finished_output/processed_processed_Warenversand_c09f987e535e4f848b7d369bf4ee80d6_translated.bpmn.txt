 The process begins with the 'Shipment' start event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway3' to initiate the 'Pick up goods' task. This task then leads to the 'Prepare to pick up' task, which in turn triggers the 'EndEvent0'. Following this, the 'Packaging of goods' task is initiated by 'ParallelGateway3' and also leads to 'EndEvent0'. 

The 'Insurance required?' start event triggers the 'Complete insurance' task, which then leads to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is responsible for the '3 offers' task, which also leads to 'EndEvent0'. 

The 'Big crowd?' start event triggers the 'Separation Shipping' task, which leads to '3 offers'. The '3 offers' task then leads to the 'Selection' task, which triggers 'Beautfraung Speidteur'. This task is also triggered by 'Big crowd?' and leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. 

The 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by 'Big crowd?' and leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Finally, 'ExclusiveGateway2' triggers 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to 'EndEvent0'. 

In summary, the process involves several tasks and gateways, starting with the 'Shipment' event and ending with the 'EndEvent0'. The tasks and gateways are interconnected, with each task leading to the next and each gateway receiving and sending outgoing events to other tasks and gateways.
