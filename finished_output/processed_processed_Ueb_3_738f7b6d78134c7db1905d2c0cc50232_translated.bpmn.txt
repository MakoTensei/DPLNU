 Let's start with the event 'Regression possibility Report' which triggers the task 'Check the case'. This task has an exclusive gateway 'ExclusiveGateway2' that leads to 'Case closed without result'.

Next, we have the event 'Justified?' which can trigger two tasks: 'Send a message' and 'Set up a new template'. The 'Send a message' task leads to 'Payment Report' and 'Close', while the 'Set up a new template' task leads to 'Payment Report' and 'Case closed without result'.

The 'Payment Report' event then triggers the task 'Close' which has two outcomes: 'Case closed without result' and 'Case closed with incoming payment'.

The 'Case closed with incoming payment' event triggers the task 'Booking' which leads to 'Case closed with incoming payment'.

The 'Case closed without result' event triggers the task 'Proceedings' which has two outcomes: 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'Case closed without result'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' leads to 'Case closed without result' and 'Debt collection'.

The 'Debt collection' event triggers the task 'Debt collection' which leads to 'Case closed with incoming payment'.

In summary, the 'Regression possibility Report' event starts a chain of events and tasks that ultimately lead to either 'Case closed with incoming payment' or 'Case closed without result'.
