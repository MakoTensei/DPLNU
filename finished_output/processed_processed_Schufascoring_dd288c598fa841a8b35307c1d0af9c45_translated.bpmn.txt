 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the 'Scoring enroll' event, which triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' task. This task receives a 'Request Report' and sends a 'Result?' to the 'Result?' gateway. The 'Result?' gateway then forwards the 'Result?' to 'Level 1 Result send' task, which sends the 'Level 1 Result' to the appropriate recipient.

Simultaneously, the 'Level 1 Scoring' task also sends the 'Level 1 Result' to 'Results Level 1 forward' gateway, which in turn forwards it to 'Results Level 2 forward'.

The 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which is triggered by the 'Scoring enroll' event, receives the 'Level 1 Result' and sends it to the 'Level 2 Result send' task. This task then sends the 'Level 2 Result' to the 'Results Level 2 forward' gateway, which forwards it to the final destination.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Request Report' and forwards it to both the 'Level 1 Scoring' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' tasks. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' task sends the 'Level 2 Result' to the 'Results Level 2 forward' gateway.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' tasks, which are triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway1', also send the 'Level 2 Result' to the 'Results Level 2 forward' gateway.

In summary, the scoring process involves multiple tasks and gateways that work together to process and forward the results from Level 1 to Level 2 scoring, and ultimately to the final destination.
