 In the logistics process, goods are packaged and prepared for shipment through a series of interconnected tasks and gateways. The process begins with the 'Shipment' start event, which triggers the 'Provide goods for collection' task. This task receives incoming data from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Simultaneously, the 'Special shipment necessary' task is initiated, which also receives data from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends outgoing data to '3 offers to collect from forwarders'. This task is specifically for special shipments that require additional attention.

The '3 offers to collect from forwarders' task, upon receiving data from 'A lot?', directs users to 'Select your offer'. This task is designed to present users with multiple collection options.

The 'Select your offer' task, in turn, receives data from 'A lot?' and sends outgoing data to 'Specialist'. This task helps users choose the most suitable collection option.

The 'Specialist' task, upon receiving data from 'A lot?', sends outgoing data to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task involves a specialist who handles the collection process and ensures that the goods are collected efficiently.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' task, which receives data from 'Insurance?' and 'A lot?', sends outgoing data to 'EndEvent0'. This gateway is responsible for handling insurance-related tasks and concluding the collection process.

Meanwhile, the 'normal mail order' task, which receives data from 'A lot?', sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task is for standard package orders that do not require special attention.

The 'fill out standard package tickets' task, upon receiving data from 'fill out standard package tickets', sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task involves completing the necessary paperwork for standard package shipments.

Lastly, the 'Complete insurance' task, which receives data from 'ParallelGateway6', sends outgoing data to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task ensures that the insurance process is completed for the shipment.
