 In the world of automated scoring systems, a series of events and gateways work together to process requests and deliver results. Let's dive into the flow of this system:

1. The process begins when a request for scoring is made, either by the frontend or the bank. This request is sent to the EventBasedGateway3, which is responsible for routing incoming requests to the appropriate gateways.

2. EventBasedGateway3 receives the 'Request vpm\nFrontend' and forwards it to ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway is responsible for handling the initial stages of the scoring process.

3. ExclusiveGateway0 receives the 'Scoring result received' message and sends it to the Reporting of results gateway. This gateway is responsible for reporting the scoring results to the appropriate parties.

4. Simultaneously, ExclusiveGateway0 also receives the 'Ask question' message and sends it to the Ask question gateway. This gateway is responsible for asking the necessary questions to gather more information for the scoring process.

5. The Ask question gateway receives the 'Scoring result received' message and sends it to the Reporting of results gateway.

6. The Reporting of results gateway receives the 'Scoring result received' message from both ExclusiveGateway0 and the Ask question gateway. It then sends a 'Scoring request\nFinished' message to the Scoring request edited gateway.

7. The Scoring request edited gateway receives the 'carried out' message and sends it to the Registration for bank gateway. This gateway is responsible for registering the bank for the scoring process.

8. The Registration for bank gateway receives the 'carried out' message and sends a 'Result message to Bank' message to the Scoring request edited gateway.

9. The Scoring request edited gateway receives the 'Result message to Bank' message and sends a 'Scoring request edited' message to the ExclusiveGateway2.

10. ExclusiveGateway2 receives the 'Scoring request edited' message and sends it to the Scoring request edited gateway.

11. The Scoring request edited gateway receives the 'carried out' message and sends it to the Exclus
