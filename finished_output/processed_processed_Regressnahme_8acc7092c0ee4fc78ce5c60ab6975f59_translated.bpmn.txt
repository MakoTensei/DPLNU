 The process begins with the 'possible Regression' event, which triggers the 'Existence Regress claim?' gateway. This gateway has two outgoing paths: one leading to the 'Check the case' task and another to the 'Money received' task. The 'Check the case' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, the 'Money received' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'EventBasedGateway4' is triggered by both the 'possible Regression' event and the 'On re-\nikea' event. This gateway has three outgoing paths: one leading to the 'Close' task, one leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', and another leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Close' task connects directly to 'EndEvent0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' leads to the 'Giving debt service providers' task, while the 'ExclusiveGateway3' leads to the 'VN contradicts' task, which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'VN contradicts' event also triggers the 'Objection deadline expired' event, which connects to the 'Giving debt service providers' task.

In summary, the process starts with the 'possible Regression' event, which leads to the 'Check the case' and 'Money received' tasks. The 'EventBasedGateway4' is triggered by both the 'possible Regression' and 'On re-\nikea' events, leading to the 'Close', 'ExclusiveGateway2', and 'ExclusiveGateway3' tasks. The 'VN contradicts' event leads to the 'EndEvent0' and 'Objection deadline expired' events, which connect to the 'Giving debt service providers' task.
