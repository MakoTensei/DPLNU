 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Get 3 quotes' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task. The 'Clearing the shipping mode' task then connects to the 'Lot?' gateway, which forwards the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Once the 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the request, it connects to the 'Check the insurance requirement' task, which is triggered by the 'Lot?' gateway. The 'Check the insurance requirement' task then connects to the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, which forwards the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ExclusicveGateway2' then connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, which is triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway. The 'Complete insurance' task connects back to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', completing the insurance process.

After the insurance process, the 'ExclusiveGateway2' connects to the 'Packaging goods' task, which is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Packaging goods' task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which forwards the process to the 'Delivering goods' task.

The 'Delivering goods' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway5' and connects to the 'Goods delivered' event, which marks the end of the process.
