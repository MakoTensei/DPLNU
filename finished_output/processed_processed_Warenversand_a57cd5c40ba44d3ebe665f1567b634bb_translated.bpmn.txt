 When a shipment arrives, the process begins with the 'Shipment' event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Packaging goods' task then sends a 'Volume' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn sends a 'packaged product provided' message to the 'End Events'.

Once the 'Volume' message is received by 'ExclusiveGateway2', the process continues with the 'Select your offer' task. This task receives the 'Volume' message and sends a 'Specialist' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Specialist' task then sends a 'packaged product provided' message to the 'End Events'.

If the 'Insurance required?' message is received by 'ExclusiveGateway2', the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered. This task sends a 'packaged product provided' message to the 'End Events'.

The 'Pick up offers' task receives the 'Volume' message and sends a 'Select your offer' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Select your offer' task then sends a 'Specialist' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn sends a 'packaged product provided' message to the 'End Events'.

Finally, the 'Delivering goods' task receives the 'packaged product provided' message and sends a 'packaged product provided' message to the 'End Events'.

In summary, the shipment process involves packaging the goods, selecting an offer, filling the package note (if required), and delivering the goods, all of which are coordinated through the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and result in the 'packaged product provided' message being sent to the 'End Events'.
