 In the system, a Regression Report triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The Regression Report first goes through the Regression Possibility Gateway, which then sends the report to the Payment Request Creation and ExclusiveGateway2. The Payment Request Creation task is responsible for creating a payment request, and it sends the report to the Regression Check task.

The Regression Check task, along with the Reasons Check task, are both sent to ExclusiveGateway2. The ExclusiveGateway2 then forwards the reports to the Justified? Gateway, which in turn sends the reports to ExclusiveGateway3 and EndEvent0.

The Justified? Gateway sends the Reasons Check report to ExclusiveGateway3, which then sends the report to the Tax on Debt Collection Office task.

Meanwhile, the Regression Check task also sends the Regression Report to the Book the Entrance task, which then sends the report to the Payment Report. The Payment Report is received by the Case Close task, which sends the report to EndEvent0.

In summary, the Regression Report initiates a chain of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the creation of a payment request, the booking of an entrance, and the closure of a case.
