 In the bustling world of financial transactions, a series of events and tasks unfold to ensure the seamless processing of bank scoring requests. The journey begins with a 'Request of which: Frontend' event, which triggers a chain of interactions among various gateways and services.

The 'Request of which: Frontend' event initiates the process by sending a bank scoring request to the system. This request is received by the 'EventBasedGateway2', which is responsible for handling incoming messages related to the event. The gateway then forwards the request to the 'Score value (sofort) obtained' service, which promptly provides the score value.

Simultaneously, the 'Score value (sofort) obtained' service sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which is designed to handle specific types of messages. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then directs the message to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the first task.

As the process continues, the 'Score\navailable?' event is triggered, signaling the availability of the score. This event is received by the 'Score\navailable?' service, which sends a message to both 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent2'. These end events signify the completion of the second and third tasks, respectively.

In parallel, the 'Score value (delayed)' service, which is also connected to the 'EventBasedGateway2', receives a message from the 'Delay message obtained' event. This message is then sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn directs it to the 'EndEvent2'.

The 'Score value (delayed)' service, upon receiving the message, sends a score value to the 'Send a score value' service, which then sends the score to the 'EndEvent0'. This marks the completion of the fourth task.

Finally, the 'Score\navailable?' event is received by the 'Score\navailable?' service, which sends a message to both 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent2', completing the fifth and sixth tasks.

Throughout this intricate process, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' plays a crucial role in directing messages to the appropriate services and end events, ensuring that each
