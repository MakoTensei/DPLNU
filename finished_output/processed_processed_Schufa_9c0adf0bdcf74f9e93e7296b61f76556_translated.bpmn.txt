 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Scoring request' task, which then sends a'received result?' message to the'received result?' gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends a'send reply with waiting message' to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' gateway.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Level 1 Score' task, which sends a 'Level 1 Score' message to the 'Level 1 Score' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'prepare notification with delay message' to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway, upon receiving the 'Level 2 necessary?' message, sends a'send reply with scoring result to bank' message to the 'EndEvent2' and'send reply with scoring result to bank' to the 'ExclusiveGateway4' gateway.

The 'ExclusiveGateway4' gateway, upon receiving the'send reply with scoring result to bank' message, sends an 'EndEvent2' message.

Meanwhile, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' gateway, upon receiving the'send reply with waiting message' message, sends an 'EndEvent1' message.

The 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent2' events mark the completion of their respective tasks.
