 In the process of handling a case involving VN, the workflow begins with VN reporting an issue, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The first task, 'Check regression case', is initiated upon VN's report and directs the workflow to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, 'Payment on Request for VN' is also triggered by the same incoming event, leading to a similar pathway to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


As the case progresses, 'Proceedings' is initiated in response to the 'Opposition of VN', again converging towards 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, 'Dispense process of collection' is activated by 'EventBasedGateway4', which also sends the workflow to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


The 'Regress?' gateway, upon receiving the 'VN reported' event, sends the workflow to 'Incoming payment' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Reimbursement period Expired' event, triggered by 'Reimbursement?', directs the workflow to 'Process completed'.


The 'Complete the process' task is activated by 'Opposition of VN' and 'EventBasedGateway4', leading to the final 'Process completed' event.


Throughout this process, 'ExclusiveGateway2' serves as a critical juncture, receiving multiple incoming events from various tasks and gateways, and ultimately directing the workflow to 'Process completed'.
