 In a workflow involving various tasks, gateways, start events, and end events, the following sequence unfolds:

The process begins with the 'Schufascoring' start event, which triggers the 'Scoring request' task. This task, identified by'sid-7342EDFB-9928-4C68-840E-483BCA59782C', is responsible for initiating the scoring process.

The 'Scoring request' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway, identified by'sid-F08E6B48-5864-4FE4-8035-9C5E68074A55'. This gateway receives the scoring request and directs it to either the 'EndEvent2' or'sid-F7E09CC6-BA6A-4CF0-A2D5-A6664F728647' outgoing connections.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' task also leads to the 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway, identified by'sid-47832CA2-0D21-4BC7-8D1B-374DD272F312'. This gateway receives the scoring request and sends it to either 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' or 'Informing the front'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, identified by'sid-1645D3CD-838B-4508-9C44-50FBEC8C4D13', is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway1' and sends the results to 'Informing the front'.

The 'Scoring Level 2' task, identified by'sid-1766E0B2-668E-4CFA-B6B8-72EA659922E7', is triggered by the 'Scoring request' task and sends the results to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Editing scoring' task, identified by'sid-27
