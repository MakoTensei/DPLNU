 Starting with the event 'possible regression we have discussed', the process begins by sending a message to 'Send a message'. This message triggers the 'Check the case' task, which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Upon reaching 'ExclusiveGateway3', the task 'Check the case' is directed to 'Set process for resubmission', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Set process for resubmission' task is also linked to 'Regressability is there?', which further leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Set process for resubmission'.

The 'Set process for resubmission' task is completed, and the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Here, the 'Check the case' task is directed to 'Regression is completed', which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Regression is completed' task is then directed to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which connects to 'Denial of payment justified?' and 'Process completed'.

The 'Denial of payment justified?' task is completed, and the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. Here, the 'Objection Report' task is directed to 'Process completed'.

Finally, the process ends with the 'Regression is completed' task, which is triggered by the 'Money is Report' event.

In summary, the process starts with a message about a possible regression, leading to a series of tasks and gateways that ultimately result in the completion of the regression process.
