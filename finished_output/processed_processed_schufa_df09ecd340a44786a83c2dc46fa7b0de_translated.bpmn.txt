 In the lead scoring process, there are two levels: Level 1 through Level 2. Level 1 starts with the 'Receptions\nScoring\nQuestion' event, which can be triggered by the 'Start\nProcess' event. This event leads to the 'Simple\nScoring\npossible?' event, which has incoming connections from 'Receptions\nScoring\nQuestion' and outgoing connections to'sid-2FCDA54C-90B7-4944-AD30-60066A764306' and'sid-EC3C9F15-F973-432C-B52F-98C3E1A018EA'.

Level 2 begins with the 'Receptions\nScoring\nQuestion' event, which can also be triggered by the 'Start\nProcess' event. This event leads to the 'L2 scoring\nResult' event, which has incoming connections from'sid-20577E5C-4F01-4DE5-BF06-706B732F5A51' and outgoing connections to'sid-45282009-C73B-414B-94EC-CE1579A2C76D'.

The process is managed by two ExclusiveGateways: 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. 'ExclusiveGateway0' has incoming connections from 'Start\nProcess' and 'Receptions\nScoring\nQuestion', and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent0' and 'Receptions\nDelay\nNote'. 'ExclusiveGateway1' has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and'sid-52342BFA-F8EA-4FAC-BF8C-642CB878BC4F', and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent1'.

The process concludes with two EndEvents: 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1', which have incoming connections
