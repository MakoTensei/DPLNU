 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to receive the incoming package. This gateway then connects to the 'Create a package ticket' process, which requires an 'Insurance necessary?' inquiry. If insurance is needed, the process diverges to the 'Insurance close' gateway, which in turn connects to the 'Goods are ready for collection' process.

If insurance is not necessary, the 'Create a package ticket' process connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then leads to the 'Special delivery?' process. This process diverges to the 'Special delivery?' gateway, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' to continue the shipping process.

Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to the 'Clearing the shipping mode' process, which diverges to the 'Special delivery?' gateway. This gateway then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to the 'ParallelGateway5' to continue the shipping process.

Once the package reaches the 'ParallelGateway5', it connects to the 'Goods are ready for collection' process, which marks the end of the shipping process.
