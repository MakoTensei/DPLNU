 The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task, in turn, sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then routes the goods to 'Request offers' and 'Filling the package note'. The 'Filling the package note' task sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then allows the goods to be sent. Meanwhile, 'Request offers' task sends the goods to 'Provide goods for collection'. The 'Provide goods for collection' task sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4', which then completes the 'Complete insurance' task. Finally, the goods are sent to the end event 'Goods can be sent'.
