 The process begins with the 'Perhaps\nin Regress\nremovable VN' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to take over the case. This is followed by the 'Regression possible?' event, which leads to the 'VN paid' event. The 'Opposition\narrived' event then results in the 'VN has\nhas been successful\nreproach' event. Finally, the 'Date of expiry' event concludes the process, with the 'debtor\ntakes over the case' event.

Here's a more natural flow description:

1. The process starts with the 'Perhaps\nin Regress\nremovable VN' event. This event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which takes over the case.

2. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then receives the 'Regression possible?' event. This event leads to the 'VN paid' event, indicating that the Vendor has been paid.

3. The 'Opposition\narrived' event is then triggered. This event results in the 'VN has\nhas been successful\nreproach' event, indicating that the opposition has been successful.

4. Finally, the 'Date of expiry' event occurs, and the 'debtor\ntakes over the case' event is triggered, indicating that the debtor now takes over the case.
