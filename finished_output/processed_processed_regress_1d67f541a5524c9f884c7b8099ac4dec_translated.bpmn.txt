 The process begins with the event 'VN may be taken in regress' (sid-13F1D99F-625E-440B-9DEC-58B9071B16A1), which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-9B38D939-1096-43A2-B003-638F0B21CC18). This leads to the 'Check the case' task (sid-sid-53396495-9261-4C46-A5F6-C242BCB9BA9A).

Next, the 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-9B38D939-1096-43A2-B003-638F0B21CC18) receives the 'VN may be taken in regress' (sid-13F1D99F-625E-440B-9DEC-58B9071B16A1) again, which triggers the 'Send payment request to VN' (sid-BF906D37-8FDA-4868-880A-3FCB4411906C).

The 'Send payment request to VN' (sid-BF906D37-8FDA-4868-880A-3FCB4411906C) then leads to the 'Money received' task (sid-E4DFA1E7-3217-4960-B3C9-CB353C2BF50C).

The 'Money received' task (sid-E4DFA1E7-3217-4960-B3C9-CB353C2BF50C) triggers the 'Money\nReport' task (sid-05981108-0A5D-4EBC-9E41-63
