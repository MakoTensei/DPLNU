 The process begins with the 'Goods Ship' start event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' to initiate the process. This leads to the 'Lot?' task, which in turn sends the 'Goods Ship' to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then connects to 'Insurance Necessary?' task, which checks if insurance is needed and sends the 'Goods Ship' to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Simultaneously, the 'Lot?' task also sends the 'Goods Ship' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then connects to the 'Specialist' task, which handles the selection of the shipping service provider. The 'Specialist' task sends the 'Goods Ship' to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' then connects to the 'Provide Package for Collection' task, which prepares the package for collection. This task sends the 'Goods Ship' to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.
