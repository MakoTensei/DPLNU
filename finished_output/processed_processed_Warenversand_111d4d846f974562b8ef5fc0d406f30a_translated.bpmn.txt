 When a shipping requirement is triggered, the process begins with the 'Filling the package note' task, which is initiated by the 'Shipping required' start event. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway3' and sends its output to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' then triggers the 'Check insurance requirements' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Upon completion, 'Check insurance requirements' sends its output to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Next, 'ExclusiveGateway0' sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn triggers the 'Determine item size' task. This task is connected to 'Shipping required' and sends its output to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'ParallelGateway3' then triggers the 'Select the Spediteur' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Select the Spediteur' task sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

'ExclusiveGateway0' sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task is connected to 'Shipping required' and sends its output to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' then triggers the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway4'. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task sends its output to 'Product\nPickup ready', marking the end of the process.
