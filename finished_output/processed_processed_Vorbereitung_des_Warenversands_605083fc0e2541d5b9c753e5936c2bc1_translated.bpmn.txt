 The process begins at the Shipyard, where the task is to pick up at least three freight forwarders. This task is initiated by the 'Shipyard' start event and is connected to the 'Pick up at least three freight forwarders' task through the 'ParallelGateway4'. Once the freight forwarders are selected, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which checks the insurance requirements for the 'Big crowd?' scenario. If insurance is required, the process proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway3', where the insurance is completed. Concurrently, the 'Check insurance requirements' task also leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. After the insurance is confirmed, the process continues to 'ParallelGateway5', where the goods are packaged and then delivered. The 'Goods delivered' end event signifies the completion of the process.
