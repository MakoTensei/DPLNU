 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the clearing of goods dispatch, which then proceeds to 'ParallelGateway1'. From there, the process branches out to three different Spediteur 1 pickups, each leading to 'ParallelGateway2'. Concurrently, a 'Special shipment necessary?' inquiry is made, which also connects to 'ParallelGateway2'. This inquiry can lead to a 'Specialist' or 'Insurance required?' depending on the response.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the packaging of goods, which is then provided for collection through 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Insurance required?' inquiry can also lead to 'EndEvent0' if the insurance is deemed necessary.

The 'ParallelGateway2' acts as a central hub, receiving inputs from both the Spediteur 1 pickups and the 'Special shipment necessary?' inquiry. It then forwards the goods to the 'Specialist' or the 'EndEvent0' based on the previous responses.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' concludes the process, receiving inputs from both the 'Insurance required?' inquiry and the 'Complete insurance' task.
