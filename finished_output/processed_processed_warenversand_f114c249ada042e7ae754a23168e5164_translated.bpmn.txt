 When goods are ready for dispatch, the process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task checks if insurance is necessary, and if so, it connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' which then leads to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task. This task, in turn, connects to the 'Specialist' task, which also goes through 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Concurrently, the 'Filling the package note' task also connects to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Once the cheapest offer is chosen, the 'Specialist' task connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which then leads to the 'Provide goods for collection' task. This task connects to 'ParallelGateway4' again, which finally leads to the 'Goods sent' event, marking the completion of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task checks for insurance necessity and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which leads to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task. The 'Specialist' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Both tasks then connect to 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to the 'Provide goods for collection' task. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to the 'Goods sent' event, completing the process.
