 Starting with the event 'goods to be shipped\n', the process unfolds as follows:

1. The goods are first assessed for insurance necessity through the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, which determines if 'ExclusiveGateway1' is the next step.

2. If insurance is deemed necessary, the process continues to 'ExclusiveGateway1', where the quantity of goods is evaluated.

3. Depending on the quantity, the goods are either packaged ('Packaging of goods') or added to the cart ('Add to Cart').

4. If the quantity is large, the goods are packaged and sent to 'ParallelGateway6', which then connects to 'Shipment'.

5. If the quantity is small, the goods are added to the cart and sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

6. At 'ExclusiveGateway4', the goods are shipped, and the process concludes with the 'Goods are shipped' event.

In summary, the process begins with assessing the need for insurance, followed by determining the quantity of goods. Based on the quantity, the goods are either packaged or added to the cart, leading to either 'Shipment' or 'Goods are shipped', respectively.
