 The process begins with the 'Regression report' event, which triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway, leading to the 'Check the case' task. Following this, the 'Money received' event prompts the 'Book the entrance' task, and the 'Notification' event initiates the 'Proceedings' task. The 'EventBasedGateway3' then connects the 'Check the case', 'Book the entrance', and 'Proceedings' tasks to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which ultimately leads to the 'Closed' event. Concurrently, the 'EventBasedGateway3' also connects the 'Money received' and 'Notification' events to the 'Money received' and 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider' tasks, respectively. The 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider' task is the final step in the process, leading to the 'Closed' event.
