 Starting with the 'Order to receive' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Order to receive' event triggers the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for packaging the goods. This process also involves 'Set shipping mode' to determine the shipping method.

2. Once the goods are packaged, the 'ParallelGateway5' initiates a special shipment through 'initiate special shipment'. This process is linked to 'Offer 1' and 'Offer 2', which are presented to the customer to choose the cheapest option.

3. The customer selects the cheapest offer, which is 'Offer 1'. This selection leads to 'Choose the cheapest offer' event, which in turn triggers 'ParallelGateway7'.

4. 'ParallelGateway7' then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which is responsible for finalizing the shipment process.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4', where the 'Complete insurance' process is initiated. This process involves 'InclusiveGateway2', which fills the shipping note.

6. The 'Complete insurance' process is followed by 'Set shipping mode' to finalize the shipping details.

7. Finally, the goods are ready for collection, and the 'Goods are ready for collection' event is triggered, marking the end of the process.
