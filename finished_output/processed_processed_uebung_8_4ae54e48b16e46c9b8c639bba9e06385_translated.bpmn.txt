 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive way, fitting into one paragraph:

When a guest experiences hunger, they place an order, triggering the selection of a restaurant. Upon arrival at the restaurant, the guest is seated in the dining area. The guest then places their order, which is received by the restaurant staff. The order is processed, and the meal is prepared and put into the reach for pickup. The restaurant staff informs the guest that their meal is ready for pickup, and the guest proceeds to pick up their meal.

Meanwhile, the restaurant's system triggers an event based on the guest's order, which sends a notification to the kitchen to prepare the meal. Once the meal is ready, the kitchen staff places the meal in the reach for pickup. The restaurant staff then informs the guest that their meal is ready for pickup, and the guest retrieves their meal.

After picking up the meal, the restaurant's system sends a notification to the kitchen, indicating that the meal has been picked up. The kitchen staff then retrieves the meal from the reach and completes the order for the guest.

In summary, the guest experiences hunger, places an order, and is seated at the restaurant. The order is processed, and the meal is prepared and put into the reach for pickup. The guest picks up their meal, and the order is completed.
