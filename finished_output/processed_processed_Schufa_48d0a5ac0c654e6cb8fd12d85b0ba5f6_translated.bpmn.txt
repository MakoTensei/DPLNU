 In the bustling world of financial services, a complex workflow unfolds as a Scoring Request from a bank triggers a series of events and interactions between various systems and gateways. The journey begins with a Schufascoring request, which is discussed and then leads to the initiation of Level 1 and Level 2 scoring processes.

The first step in this process is the Schufascoring request from the bank, which is communicated to the ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway then forwards the request to the Get Level 1 scoring service, which in turn communicates the Level 1 Scoring to the bank.

Meanwhile, the Level 2 Scoring process is also initiated, with the Schufascoring request being communicated to the ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway then forwards the Level 2 Scoring to the bank.

As the Level 1 Scoring progresses, the Level 1 Scoring communicating event is triggered, which is received by the ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway then completes the Scoring process and sends the Scoring completed event to the bank.

Simultaneously, the Level 2 Scoring process also reaches its conclusion, with the Level 2 Scoring communicating event being received by the ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway then completes the Scoring process and sends the Scoring completed event to the bank.

Throughout this intricate workflow, other tasks such as Level 1 and Level 2 scoring delays are managed, ensuring that the entire process runs smoothly and efficiently.

In summary, the Scoring Request from the bank initiates a series of events and interactions between various systems and gateways, ultimately leading to the completion of the Level 1 and Level 2 scoring processes. This complex workflow ensures that the bank receives accurate and timely scoring results, enabling them to make informed decisions and provide the best possible service to their customers.
