 The process begins with the event 'True should be sent', which triggers the 'Pick up three offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4' and leads to the 'Select a quote' task. The 'Select a quote' task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is responsible for sending the 'Order Spediteuer' task. This task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which leads to 'Fill standard parking ticket'. The 'Fill standard parking ticket' task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' again, which then sends the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task leads to the 'Complete insurance' task. Finally, the 'True is ready' event triggers the 'Provide True to Pickup' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0', leading to the 'Select a quote' task. This process ensures that all tasks are executed in the correct order, with each task being connected to the appropriate gateways.
