 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'Start scoring' event, which triggers the 'First result scoring' gateway, leading to the'sid-6C910084-27AA-4A62-AAA8-F7BC9E6F2741' task. This task then proceeds to the 'Result Schufa' gateway, resulting in the 'First result scoring' task. Concurrently, another 'Start scoring' event initiates the 'Result 1Level' gateway, leading to the'sid-CDC40411-3341-4CC1-8B76-7C0DBC96F620' task. The 'First result scoring' task concludes with the 'Result Scoring Final' event, which triggers the 'EndEvent0' task. Meanwhile, the 'Result 1Level' task ends with the 'EndEvent1' task, marking the completion of the scoring process.
