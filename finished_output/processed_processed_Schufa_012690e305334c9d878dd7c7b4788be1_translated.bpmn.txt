 When you initiate your inquiry, the system starts the process by triggering the 'StartEvent0' which then forwards the answer to the 'EndEvent0'. Following this, the 'Schufascoring Level 1' begins, receiving the 'StartEvent1' and eventually leading to the 'Final result' after passing through the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Concurrently, the 'Schufascoring Level 2' commences, starting with 'StartEvent2' and concluding with 'EndEvent2'. Lastly, the 'Check credit award' process is initiated with 'StartEvent2', which concludes with 'EndEvent3'.
