 In the case of a reported regression possibility, the process begins with the 'Check the case' task, which is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the opposition is justified, the process transitions to 'Close' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. For incoming payments, the 'Incoming payment\nbook' task is initiated, leading to 'Process\ncompleted' after passing through 'ExclusiveGateway1'. When a 'V\nagainst' event occurs, it also routes to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Regression\npossible?' event triggers 'Check the case' and 'EventBasedGateway4', which in turn sends the case to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'Debt service provider\ncommission'. The 'Process\nReimbursement\nset and payment request\nsend' task, upon receiving a 'Report\nRegression possibility', is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Finally, the process concludes with 'Process\ncompleted' after handling the 'Incoming payment\nbook' and 'Reimbursement\nDate\nExpired' events.
