 Let's trace the flow of events for the shipment process:

1. The process starts with the event 'Goods are to be shipped' (sid-E007F434-258E-4D4B-BC0F-2C149E7B2638). This triggers the 'Filling the package note' task (sid-4598516D-B351-4BBB-8BED-E7824952863E) as it has an incoming link to 'Goods are to be shipped'.
