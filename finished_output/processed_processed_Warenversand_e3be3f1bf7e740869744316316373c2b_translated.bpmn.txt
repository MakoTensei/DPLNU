 In a bustling logistics hub, a series of tasks are orchestrated to ensure the seamless delivery of goods. The process begins when goods are dispatched, triggering the 'Goods dispatched they are' task, which connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway then leads to 'Spediteur offers to go', prompting the search for a forwarder. Once a forwarder is found, the 'Spelling' task is initiated, which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Check shipping quantity' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway4', branches off to 'Spediteur offers to go' and 'Search forwarder'. The 'Search forwarder' task, upon receiving the 'Quantity large or small?' input, connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Check if insurance is required' task, which also receives input from 'ParallelGateway4', branches off to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is crucial as it determines whether insurance is necessary for the shipment.

Meanwhile, the 'Insurance close' task, which receives input from 'Check if insurance is required', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task ensures that the insurance process is completed before the goods are shipped.

The 'Delivering goods' task, which receives input from'sid-A5685D99-A644-452B-BBCD-CA600A9428D7', branches off to 'Goods Ship ready'. This task signifies the final stage of the delivery process, where the goods are ready to be shipped.

In summary, the logistics process begins with the dispatch of goods, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure the shipment is insured, forwarded, and ultimately delivered. The process involves a complex network of tasks and gateways, each playing a crucial role in the seamless delivery of goods.
