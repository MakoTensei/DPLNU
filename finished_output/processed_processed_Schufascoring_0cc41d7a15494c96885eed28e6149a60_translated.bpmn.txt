 In the scoring process, a request for scoring is initiated by the 'Scoring requested' start event, which triggers a 'forward delay' gateway. This gateway then forwards the request to the 'forward scoring' task, which performs the scoring level 1 and level 2 tasks. The 'perform scoring level 1' task sends the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which determines the scoring result and sends it to the 'Scoring determined' end event. Meanwhile, the 'perform scoring level 2' task also sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'forward scoring' task, upon obtaining the scoring result, sends it to the 'Scoring result obtained' gateway, which then leads to the 'EndEvent0' end event. Additionally, the 'forward delay' gateway can also lead to the 'Delay Not applicable' end event.
