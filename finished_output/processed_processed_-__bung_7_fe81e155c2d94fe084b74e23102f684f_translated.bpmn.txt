 In the scoring process, a request initiates with a Schufa request, which triggers the sharing of the scoring result. This request then proceeds to the ExclusiveGateway1, where it is processed in two levels. The first level, Run scoring (level 1), is obtained and subsequently leads to the sharing of the scoring design. Meanwhile, the Schufa request also triggers an EventBasedGateway2, which handles the delayed scoring request and shares the scoring design. Once the scoring design is obtained, it concludes the process with the final scoring request design event.
