 The process begins with the 'Shipment necessary' event, which triggers the 'Select your offer' task through ExclusiveGateway0. This task then leads to the 'Request offers' task via ExclusiveGateway0. The 'Request offers' task sends the 'Shipment necessary' event to 'Select your offer' task, which in turn sends an 'Order' task to ExclusiveGateway1.

The 'Order' task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1' which sends the 'Order' task to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' task sends the 'Filling the package note' task to 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'InclusiveGateway2' task sends the 'Filling the package note' task to 'InclusiveGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Filling the package note' task is then followed by the 'Packaging goods' task, which is routed to 'ParallelGateway4' through 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'Packaging goods' task sends the 'Goods packaged' task to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Goods packaged' task is then followed by the 'Delivering goods' task, which is routed to 'ParallelGateway5' through 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Delivering goods' task concludes the process by sending the 'Goods delivered' event to the end of the process.
