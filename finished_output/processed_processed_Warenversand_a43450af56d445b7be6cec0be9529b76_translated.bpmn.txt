 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4'. Once the offer is picked up, the 'Special shipment necessary?' event is triggered, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then directs the process to the 'Filling the package note' task, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. After filling the package note, the 'Special shipment necessary?' event is triggered again, leading to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway connects to the 'Packaging goods' task, which is also connected to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Packaging goods' task is followed by the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', which is triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' event. This event connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, which is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
