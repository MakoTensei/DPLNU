 The process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to handle incoming goods. This gateway then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn leads to 'Select and order freight forwarders' and 'Filling the package note' tasks. The 'Filling the package note' task sends goods to 'ParallelGateway7', while 'Select and order freight forwarders' connects to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'IntermediateCatchEvent8', which eventually leads to 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' is the final event in the process, signifying the completion of the shipping process.

Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway0' also connects to 'Complete insurance' and 'Clear insurance status' tasks. The 'Complete insurance' task connects to 'ParallelGateway7', while 'Clear insurance status' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:

1. 'Goods for shipping' event triggers 'ParallelGateway4'.
2. 'ParallelGateway4' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', leading to 'Select and order freight forwarders' and 'Filling the package note'.
3. 'Filling the package note' sends goods to 'ParallelGateway7'.
4. 'Select and order freight forwarders' connects to 'ParallelGateway6'.
5. 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'IntermediateCatchEvent8', leading to 'EndEvent0'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway0' connects to 'Complete insurance' and 'Clear insurance status', with 'Complete insurance' connecting to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'Clear insurance status' connecting to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
7. 'EndEvent0' signifies the completion of the shipping process.
