 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Check shipping mode' task. If the shipping mode is special, the process moves to the 'Shipping is special shipping?' gateway, which then leads to either the 'Insurance required?' task or the 'Packaging goods' task, depending on the outcome. If insurance is required, the process proceeds to the 'Insurance close' task, and if not, it moves to the 'Packaging goods' task.

If the shipping mode is not special, the process goes to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task, which then leads to the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway. From there, the process can either go to the 'Packaging goods' task or the 'Delivering goods' task, depending on the chosen offer.

In both cases, the process ends with the 'EndEvent0' task, which has incoming connections from both the 'Shipping is special shipping?' gateway and the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway.
