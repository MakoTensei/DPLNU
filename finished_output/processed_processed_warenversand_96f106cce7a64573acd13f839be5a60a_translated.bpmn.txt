 When a customer initiates a shipment process, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' and branches into different paths based on the specific requirements of the shipment.

Firstly, the system checks whether the goods are to be shipped. If the customer confirms, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then forks into two parallel paths. One path leads to 'ParallelGateway3', where the quantity of goods is clarified, and the other path leads to 'ParallelGateway4', which handles the 'normal mail order' process.

In the 'normal mail order' path, the system prompts the customer to fill in the parcel details and inquire about the necessity of insurance. This information is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then directs the process to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Here, the customer's request for insurance is processed by the Logistics Manager.

Meanwhile, the 'quantity clarification' path at 'ParallelGateway3' leads to the 'Offer Spedition Three Pick Up' option, which sends the customer to 'ParallelGateway4'. This path also offers a 'Special offer' option, which sends the customer to 'ParallelGateway4' again.

The 'Ordering Spedition' path at 'ParallelGateway4' leads to the 'Selection of an offer' process, which sends the customer to 'ParallelGateway4' once more.

In summary, the shipment process starts with 'StartEvent0', and based on the customer's input, it branches into different paths to clarify the shipment details, offer special deals, and handle insurance requests. The process concludes at 'EndEvent0'.
