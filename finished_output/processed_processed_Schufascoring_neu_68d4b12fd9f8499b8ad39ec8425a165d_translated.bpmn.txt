 In the banking system, a series of events and gateways are interconnected to handle scoring requests and report delays. The process begins when the event 'Schufascoring is required' triggers the start event, which sends a 'Message' to the 'Level 1\Message' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Request completed' message to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn sends a 'Request completed' message back to the start event.

Simultaneously, the 'Schufascoring is required' event also triggers the start event for the 'Level 2\Message' gateway, which sends a 'Process without result' message to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway then sends a 'Process without result' message back to the start event.

If the 'Result is fixed?' event is triggered, it sends a 'End of query' message to both the 'Level 1\Message' and 'Level 2\Message' gateways. These gateways then send an 'End of query' message back to the event.

In summary, the system handles scoring requests and report delays by triggering events and passing messages between gateways, ensuring that the appropriate actions are taken based on the incoming and outgoing messages.
