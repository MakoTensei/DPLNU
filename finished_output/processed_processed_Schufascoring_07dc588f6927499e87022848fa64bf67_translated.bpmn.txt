 In a system where tasks are managed through a series of events and gateways, the following sequence of operations takes place:

1. The 'StartEvent0' initiates the process, triggering the 'EventBasedGateway2' which sends a 'Request' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
2. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the 'Request' and, upon completion, sends a 'Follow-up' to the 'Result (Level 1)\nobtained' task.
3. The 'Result (Level 1)\nobtained' task, upon completion, sends a 'Request' to the 'Conducting First Scoring' task.
4. The 'Conducting First Scoring' task, after obtaining the result, sends a 'Request' to the 'Report the result' task.
5. The 'Report the result' task, after obtaining the result, sends a 'Request' to the 'Determine Final Scoring' task.
6. The 'Determine Final Scoring' task, upon completion, sends a 'Request' to the 'Report delay' task.
7. The 'Report delay' task, after obtaining the result, sends a 'Request' to the'sid-99A8DE72-A204-4B02-9409-E2025FBB2CC7' task.
8. The'sid-99A8DE72-A204-4B02-9409-E2025FBB2CC7' task, upon completion, sends a 'Request' to the 'Request\ncompleted' task.

This sequence of events and tasks ensures that the system processes the initial request, obtains the necessary results, and determines the final scoring based on the obtained results.
