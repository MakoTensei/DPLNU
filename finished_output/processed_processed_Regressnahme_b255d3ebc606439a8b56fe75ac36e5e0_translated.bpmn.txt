 When a "Regression reported" event occurs, the workflow begins with the task 'Check the case' (ID: sid-DC3D8DB6-03A2-4964-B058-1B868DB59660). This task checks if a regression is possible, and if so, it sends a message to the "Regression possible?" gateway (ID: sid-55C29A87-D2C2-4648-AF0A-26145F365CDE).

If the "Regression possible?" gateway receives the message, it will either close the case or forward the regression to INKASSO, depending on the outcome. If the case is closed, the task 'Send payment request to VN' (ID: sid-80AECF07-E0C1-4458-A921-EE38C583301E) is triggered, which sends a payment request to Vietnam.

If the case is forwarded to INKASSO, the task 'Send payment request to VN' is not triggered, and instead, the task 'Send payment request to VN' (ID: sid-5930979D-69EF-434B-A3E1-5ECC1ED6AF68) is triggered, which sends an invoice to Vietnam.

Once the payment is received, the task 'Payin receipt' (ID: sid-48F1C359-A2D7-425F-81EB-0D367250E740) is triggered, which sends a receipt to the client.

If the "Regression possible?" gateway determines that the regression is not possible, the task 'Close' (ID: sid-2A40DAC9-E3FE-49FE-9385-1C0D34C7762D) is triggered, which closes the case.

If the "Regression possible?" gateway determines that the regression is successful, the task 'Close' (ID: sid-2E5087C7-C2A7-4
