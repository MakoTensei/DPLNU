 When a scoring request is obtained, the process begins with the 'Schufascoring requested' event, which triggers the 'Scoring request obtained' event. This leads to the 'Result determined' gateway, which then sends the 'Scoring result at the front end' event to the front end. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Level 2 performed' task is initiated, and upon completion, the 'Scoring request finished' event is generated. This event is then directed to the 'Result determined' gateway, which sends the 'Scoring result at the front end' event back to the front end. Additionally, the 'Delay Pressemitteilung' event is triggered, which sends the 'Pressemitteilung' message to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.
