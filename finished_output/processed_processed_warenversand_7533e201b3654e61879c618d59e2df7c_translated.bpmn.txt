 In the shipment process, goods are first packaged at ParallelGateway4, which then connects to Offers by Spedi-expensive one-go to, allowing customers to select their offer. Following this, the goods are delivered, and a specialist is consulted if special delivery is necessary, as determined by the Special delivery necessary? gateway. The specialist then connects to ExclusiveGateway2, which in turn leads to the filling of the package note. If insurance is deemed necessary, the Insurance necessary? gateway connects to ExclusiveGateway1, which eventually leads to the EndEvent0. The entire process starts with the Start Shipment Ship event, which initiates the flow by connecting to ParallelGateway5.
