 Let's break down the process into a more natural flow:

1. When someone feels hungry, they trigger the "Hunger" event.
2. This event sends a signal to the "Pieper triggered" gateway, which then initiates the "Court of Justice" process.
3. The "Court of Justice" process starts at the "Court of Justice" task, which then sends a signal to the "Add your order" task.
4. The "Add your order" task sends a signal to the "Cash" gateway, which then initiates the "Pieper over" process.
5. The "Pieper over" process sends a signal to the "Forward order" task, which then sends a signal to the "Court of First Instance" task.
6. The "Court of First Instance" task starts the "Retrieve guest" process, which then sends a signal to the "EndEvent2" process.
7. The "EndEvent2" process sends a signal to the "Court of Justice\npicked up?" gateway, which then initiates the "EndEvent1" process.
8. The "EndEvent1" process sends a signal to the "Famine" process, which then ends the process.

In summary, the flow of events is as follows:

- Hunger -> Pieper triggered -> Court of Justice -> Add your order -> Cash -> Pieper over -> Forward order -> Court of First Instance -> Retrieve guest -> EndEvent2 -> Court of Justice\npicked up? -> EndEvent1 -> Famine.
