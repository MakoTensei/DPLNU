 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'ParallelGateway6' to handle the incoming goods. This gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway8', which is responsible for delivering the goods.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway4' is also handling the incoming goods and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which checks the insurance requirements for the goods.

Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which fills the package note for the goods. This gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for delivering the goods.

After the goods are delivered, 'ParallelGateway8' connects to 'Goods ready for dispatch', marking the end of the process.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:

1. 'Goods are to be shipped' triggers 'ParallelGateway6'.
2. 'ParallelGateway6' connects to 'ParallelGateway8' for delivery.
3. 'ParallelGateway4' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1' for insurance requirements.
4. 'ParallelGateway4' connects to 'ParallelGateway5' for package note filling.
5. 'ParallelGateway5' connects to 'ParallelGateway6' for delivery.
6. 'ParallelGateway8' connects to 'Goods ready for dispatch' to mark the end of the process.
