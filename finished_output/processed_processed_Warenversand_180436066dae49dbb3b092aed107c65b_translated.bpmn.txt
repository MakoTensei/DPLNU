 The process begins with the 'Goods send' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle the incoming goods. This gateway then routes the goods to 'ParallelGateway7' for further processing.

Next, the 'Pick up offers from three freight forwarders' task is initiated, which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task involves selecting a quote and ordering a spediteur, and it sends the 'Special shipment?' message to the gateway.

The 'Special shipment?' message is received by 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then forwards the goods to 'ParallelGateway7'.

Once the goods are ready for pickup, the 'Goods ready for pickup' event is triggered, sending the goods to 'ParallelGateway7'. This gateway then sends the goods to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.

Throughout this process, the 'Insurance close' task is also triggered, which sends the 'Insurance necessary?' message to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then forwards the message to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway7'.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:
1. 'Goods send' event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway1'
2. 'Pick up offers from three freight forwarders' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'
3. 'Special shipment?' message is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'
4. 'Goods ready for pickup' event sends goods to 'ParallelGateway7'
5. 'Insurance close' task sends 'Insurance necessary?' message to 'ExclusiveGateway3'
6. 'ParallelGateway5' receives the message and sends goods to 'ParallelGateway7'
7. 'EndEvent0' marks the completion of the process.
