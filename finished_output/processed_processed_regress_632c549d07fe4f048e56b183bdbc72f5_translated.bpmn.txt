 In a financial operations system, various tasks and gateways are interconnected to ensure smooth processing of transactions and events. Here's a natural flow description of the system using the provided data:

1. A 'Regression report' is generated and sent to the system. This report triggers a 'Regression possibility' gateway, which in turn initiates a 'VN payment request' and closes the gateway.

2. The 'VN payment request' is processed, and upon successful completion, a 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider' event is triggered. This event has incoming connections from 'Proceedings' and 'VN contradicts' events.

3. When 'VN contradicts' is received, it triggers a 'Not justified' gateway, which then leads to the 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider' event and closes the gateway.

4. Concurrently, the 'Cash receipt from the VN' event is processed through the 'EventBasedGateway2', which results in a 'Cash receipt is booked' event.

5. The 'Default period expired' event, which has incoming connections from 'Set case on counter-subject', triggers a 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider' event and closes the gateway.

6. Finally, the 'Close' gateway is triggered by the 'Regression possibility' and 'Not justified' gateways, marking the end of the process.

This interconnected system ensures that all events and tasks are processed efficiently, with clear connections between incoming and outgoing events and tasks.
