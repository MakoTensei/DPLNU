 In the logistics process, the following sequence of tasks and gateways are involved:

1. Goods are sent, triggering the 'Goods to be sent' start event. This leads to the 'Quantity > x' gateways, which in turn connects to 'ParallelGateway4'.

2. 'ParallelGateway4' receives the 'Goods to be sent' event and forwards it to 'ParclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway7'.

3. 'ParallelGateway2' processes the 'Goods to be sent' event and checks if insurance is required. If it is, it sends a 'Complete insurance' event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

4. 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Goods to be sent' and 'Complete insurance' events and forwards them to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

5. 'ParallelGateway6' receives the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5' events and sends a 'Send a message' event to 'ParallelGateway6'.

6. 'ParallelGateway6' processes the 'Send a message' event and forwards it to 'EndEvent0'.

7. 'ParallelGateway7' receives the 'Filling the package note' event from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends an 'EndEvent0' event.

8. 'EndEvent0' is the final event in the process, which is triggered by the 'Quantity > x' gateways.

This flow ensures that goods are sent, insurance is completed if required, and the package is filled and sent, with all necessary events and gateways involved in the process.
