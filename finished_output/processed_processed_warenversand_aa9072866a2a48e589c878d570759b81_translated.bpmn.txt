 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins at the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which has no incoming connections and leads to the 'Goods delivered' event. The goods are first routed through 'ExclusiveGateway0', which has incoming connections from 'Goods are to be shipped' and outgoing connections to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. At 'ExclusiveGateway2', the goods are then directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'Goods are to be shipped', and outgoing connections to 'Goods are shipped'. Once the goods are shipped, the process concludes at the 'Goods are shipped' event, which has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway3' and no outgoing connections.
