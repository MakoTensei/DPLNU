 The process begins with a 'Schufascoring request' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to forward the request to 'Scoring'. Once the 'Scoring' process is initiated, it sends a 'Scoring request' event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. After the scoring process is completed, the 'Scoring completed' event is sent back to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, if the scoring process is successful, a 'Scoring completed' event is also sent to 'Scoring successful?' event, which then directs the process to 'ExclusiveGateway0' to report the 'Scoring result back'. In case of any delays, a 'Report VM delay' event is triggered, which sends the event to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. If the scoring process requires further evaluation, a 'Scoring Level 2' event is triggered, which sends the event to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Finally, when the 'Scoring result obtained' event is triggered, it sends the event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
