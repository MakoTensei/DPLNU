 Starting with the event 'Goods be sent', the process begins at the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which checks if insurance is necessary. If insurance is required, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. However, if the goods are not insurance-related, it moves to 'ParallelGateway6', where the user is prompted to fill out standard package tickets.

Once the standard package tickets are filled out, the process continues to 'ParallelGateway7', which connects to 'Spediteur 1'. Since 'Spediteur 1' is not available, the process diverts to 'Offers not available', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

At 'ExclusiveGateway3', the process checks if the user needs to select a spediteur. If a spediteur is needed, it goes to 'AppropriateSpediteur', which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' again. If no spediteur is needed, the process moves to 'Packaging goods', which connects to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Finally, at 'ParallelGateway6', the user is prompted to provide packaged goods for collection, which connects to 'Goods made available', completing the process.
