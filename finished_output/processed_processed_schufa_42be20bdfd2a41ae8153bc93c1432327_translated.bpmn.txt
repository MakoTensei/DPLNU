 When the "Button" event is triggered, it initiates the "Scoring started" event, which in turn activates the Level 1 scoring process. This process is facilitated by the "Level 1 scoring available?" event, which connects to the ExclusiveGateway1. The Level 1 scoring process then proceeds, and upon completion, the "Result is fixed" event is triggered, which is linked to the Level 2 scoring process. The Level 2 scoring process is initiated by the "Scoring started" event and is completed when the "Result obtained" event is triggered.
