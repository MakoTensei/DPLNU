 When an inquiry regarding a requirement is received, the process begins with a request for Schufa data. Upon obtaining the Schufa data, the system checks if the request is successful and if the test level 1 has been completed. If the test level 1 is successful, the system proceeds to the next step, which involves scoring the results of the test level 1. Concurrently, the system also evaluates the level 2 scoring process. Once both levels are successfully completed, the system concludes the process by generating an end event, signifying the successful completion of the inquiry.
