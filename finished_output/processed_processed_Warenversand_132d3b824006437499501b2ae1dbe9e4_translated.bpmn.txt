 In the logistics process, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure the smooth handling of goods from dispatch to delivery. Starting with the event where goods are dispatched, the journey unfolds as follows:

1. The event 'Goods dispatched they are' triggers the task 'Complete insurance' (sid-A6A3A7CB-D8CF-4C41-9706-69E00EC9B5F4) which connects with 'InclusiveGateway3' (incoming) and leads to 'InclusiveGateway2' (outgoing).

2. Concurrently, the same event also initiates the task 'Record shipping data' (sid-990ED680-372C-47BD-AF11-6418D208B738) that links with 'Goods dispatched they are' (incoming) and sends data to 'Separation who takes delivery' (outgoing).

3. The 'Separation who takes delivery' task (sid-9C50DD95-3DF2-42B5-918D-E570FDDE3294) receives data from 'Goods dispatched they are' (incoming) and connects with 'ParallelGateway5' (outgoing).

4. Meanwhile, 'Pick up a quote from spediteurs' (sid-6A8427F7-A271-4DF1-9096-B34032C03355) is triggered by 'Goods dispatched they are' (incoming) and sends information to 'InclusiveGateway2' (outgoing).

5. The 'Packaging goods' task (sid-C27CB608-FEC7-4DC3-824E-B80387ECD55B) receives data from 'ParallelGateway4' (incoming) and sends it to 'ParallelGateway5' (outgoing).

6. The 'Delivering goods' task (sid-31580
