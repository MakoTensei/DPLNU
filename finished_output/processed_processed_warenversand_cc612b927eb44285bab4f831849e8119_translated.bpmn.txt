 In the logistics process, a shipment is required, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways. The process begins with the 'Shipment Required' start event, which sends the shipment information to ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway6 receives the shipment information and initiates the 'Quantity Clarification' task, which is then passed to ParallelGateway4. Concurrently, ParallelGateway5 is also tasked with 'Request a Quote' upon receiving the shipment information.

ParallelGateway4, after clarifying the quantity, sends the 'Request a Quote' task to ParallelGateway5. Meanwhile, ParallelGateway5, after receiving the shipment information, also sends the 'Insurance Necessary?' task to InsuranceGateway2.

InsuranceGateway2, upon receiving the insurance inquiry, sends the 'Insurance Necessary?' task to ParallelGateway7, which is responsible for packaging goods. Simultaneously, ParallelGateway6 sends the 'Filling the Package Note' task to ExclusiveGateway2.

ExclusiveGateway2, upon receiving the 'Shipment Required' and 'Insurance Necessary?' tasks, sends the 'Shipment Required' task to ParallelGateway4 and the 'Insurance Necessary?' task to ParallelGateway7.

ParallelGateway4, after receiving the 'Request a Quote' task, sends it to ParallelGateway5. ParallelGateway5, after receiving the 'Request a Quote' task, sends it to ParallelGateway4 and also sends the 'ParallelGateway5' task to ExclusiveGateway3.

ParallelGateway5, upon receiving the 'ParallelGateway5' task, sends the 'ParallelGateway5' task to ExclusiveGateway3. ExclusiveGateway3, upon receiving the 'ParallelGateway5' task, sends the 'ParallelGateway5' task to ParallelGateway7.
