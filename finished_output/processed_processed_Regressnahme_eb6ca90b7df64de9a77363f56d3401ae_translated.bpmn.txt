 In a legal case management system, the following tasks and gateways are interconnected to handle various stages of a case:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway has two possible outcomes: 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and 'Closed'.

2. If the case proceeds to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', it leads to the 'Debt collection agency' task. This task is triggered by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and has an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' as its incoming event.

3. The 'Debt collection agency' task then sends a 'Get money' request to the 'Send a payment request and submit an objection' task. The 'Get money' task is triggered by the 'Send a payment request and submit an objection' task and has 'Processed' as its outgoing event.

6. If the 'Send a payment request and submit an objection' task is unsuccessful, it leads to the 'Book payment receipt' task. This task is triggered by the 'Get money' task and has 'Processed' as its outgoing event.

8. The 'Proceedings' task then leads to the 'Close' task. This task is triggered by the 'VN' task and has no outgoing events.

9. If the 'IntermediateCatch
