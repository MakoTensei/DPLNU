 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the selection of a quote, leading to the 'Select a quote' task. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Insurance close' task if the insurance is necessary. The 'Insurance close' task has two outgoing paths: 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' task. This task has two outgoing paths: 'Widen to pick up' and 'Offer 1'. The 'Offer 1' task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5', which has two outgoing paths: 'EndEvent0' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' task also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which leads to the 'ParallelGateway7'. This task has two outgoing paths: 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task has two outgoing paths: 'EndEvent0' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'EndEvent0' task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7', which has two outgoing paths: 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway7' task has two outgoing paths: 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is connected to the 'EndEvent0', which has one outgoing path: 'EndEvent0'.
