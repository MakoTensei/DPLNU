 The logistics process begins with the Secretariat bringing offers to three freight forwarders, specifically ExclusiveGateway0. This action triggers the Secretariat to fill a standardized parcel note, which is then sent to ExclusiveGateway2. The freight forwarders, upon receiving the offer, select their preferred service providers, which leads to ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway3 receives the shipping goods and passes them to ExclusiveGateway2. Meanwhile, the Secretariat also checks if insurance is necessary for the shipping mode, which results in the logistics manager locking insurance. This action is connected to ExclusiveGateway2 and ParallelGateway4.

The warehouse workers then package the goods and prepare them for collection, which is sent to ParallelGateway4. Finally, the goods are ready for shipping, and the process concludes with the goods being sent to Goods ready for shipping.

In summary, the logistics process involves the Secretariat, freight forwarders, and warehouse workers, with ExclusiveGateway0 and ParallelGateway3 playing crucial roles in the flow of goods. The process starts with the shipping of goods and ends with the goods being ready for shipping.
