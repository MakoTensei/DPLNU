 Let's start with the process of selecting a shipping mode for goods ready for dispatch. The system receives an event indicating that the goods are ready for dispatch, and this triggers the 'Select shipping mode' task. This task has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4', which is the gateway responsible for handling goods ready for dispatch.

Upon selecting the shipping mode, the system is presented with a question: "Type of shipping?" This question is handled by the 'Gateway: selected\nType of shipping?' with an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4' and an outgoing link to 'Recreational services'.

Once the shipping mode is selected, the system proceeds to the 'Fill in the Pact' task. This task has an incoming link from'selected\nType of shipping?' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway5'.

After filling in the pact, the goods are dispatched, and the 'Shipment' task is triggered. This task has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway5' and an outgoing link to 'Goods dispatched'.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. 'Goods ready for dispatch' event triggers 'Select shipping mode' task.
2. 'Select shipping mode' task presents 'Type of shipping?' question.
3. 'Type of shipping?' question is handled by 'Gateway: selected\nType of shipping?' with an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4' and an outgoing link to 'Recreational services'.
4. 'Fill in the Pact' task is triggered with an incoming link from'selected\nType of shipping?' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway5'.
5. 'Shipment' task is triggered with an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway5' and an outgoing link to 'Goods dispatched'.

This process ensures that the goods are dispatched with the selected shipping mode and all necessary steps are completed.
