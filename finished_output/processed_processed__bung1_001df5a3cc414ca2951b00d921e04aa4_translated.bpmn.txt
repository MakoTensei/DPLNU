 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Special shipment required?' task. If the special shipment is required, the task proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' for the 'Ordering goods' task. If the special shipment is not required, the task moves to the 'Filling the package note' task, which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then leads to the 'ParallelGateway5' for the 'Ordering goods' task.

The 'Ordering goods' task is followed by the 'Packaging goods' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4'. Both tasks lead to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to 'Pick up offers' and 'Special shipment required?' tasks. Depending on the special shipment requirement, the process either goes through 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5' for ordering goods or directly to 'Filling the package note' and 'ExclusiveGateway0' for the same. The process concludes with 'Ordering goods' and 'Packaging goods' tasks, both leading to 'EndEvent0'.
