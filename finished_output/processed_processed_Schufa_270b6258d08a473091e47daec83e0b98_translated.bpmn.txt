 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Start the process' task, which then sends an intermediate message to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event is followed by the 'forward waiting message' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then leads to the 'Delivering results' task, which concludes the process with 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Send a message' task, which sends a message to 'perform scoring level 2'. This task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn leads to 'perform scoring level 2' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'Level 1 possible?' event triggers 'perform scoring level 2' and 'EndEvent1' tasks, which are connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers 'Start the process' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. The 'forward waiting message' task is then executed, leading to 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'Delivering results'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' initiates 'Send a message' and 'perform scoring level 2', which are connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and lead to 'EndEvent1'.
