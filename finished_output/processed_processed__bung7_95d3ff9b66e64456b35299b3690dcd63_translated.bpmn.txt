 In the event of a "Scoring required" trigger, the system initiates a "Report delay" process, which is then forwarded to the "EventBasedGateway2". Concurrently, a "Scoring request" is received, prompting the "Send Scoring" action to be executed. As the scoring process commences, it is directed through the "ExclusiveGateway1", which subsequently sends the scoring results to the "Scoring" endpoint. Meanwhile, the "Scoring" process also receives an "Exercise available" signal, leading it to route through the "ExclusiveGateway1" and eventually to the "Scoring output" endpoint. Upon completion, the "Scoring output" is then received by the "Get delay message" event, concluding the scoring workflow.
