 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the task of determining if special shipment is necessary, which is handled by the 'Is special shipment necessary?' gateway. This gateway receives input from 'Goods are to be shipped' and directs the flow to either 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ExclusiveGateway3', depending on the need for special shipment.

If special shipment is not required, the process continues with the task of picking up three offers. This task is directed to 'ParallelGateway4' and subsequently to 'Pick up three offers'. The chosen offer is then passed to 'Choose the cheapest offer' to select the most cost-effective option.

If special shipment is required, the process involves filling the package note, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Following this, the task of choosing the cheapest offer is also directed to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

After the cheapest offer is selected, a specialist is consulted to handle the special shipment. The 'Is special shipment necessary?' gateway sends the input to 'Specialist', which then directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Once the goods are shipped, the process concludes with the delivery of the goods. The 'Delivering goods' task is directed to 'ParallelGateway5', which ultimately leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process begins with determining the need for special shipment, followed by selecting the cheapest offer, consulting a specialist, and finally delivering the goods.
