 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Start the process' task, sending an incoming event to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which in turn results in the 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent0' also sends an incoming event to 'EventBasedGateway3', which eventually delivers the 'Delivering results' task, leading to 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Send a message' task, which sends an incoming event to 'Level 1 possible?' task. This task then leads to 'perform scoring level 2', which sends an incoming event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'perform scoring level 2' task then results in 'EndEvent1'.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent1' also sends an incoming event to 'perform scoring level 1', which leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent6'. This task then sends an incoming event to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which eventually results in 'forward waiting message'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1', leading to various tasks and intermediate events, ultimately resulting in 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1'.
