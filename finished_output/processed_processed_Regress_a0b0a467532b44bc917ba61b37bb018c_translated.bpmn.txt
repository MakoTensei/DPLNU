 Upon receiving a report of a possible regression against VN, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. First, a message is sent to investigate the situation further. If a regression is confirmed, the system sets a process for resubmission. However, if VN contradicts this process, the system proceeds to ExclusiveGateway2.

At ExclusiveGateway2, the system checks for a default period expiration, which, if expired, redirects the process to ExclusiveGateway4. Concurrently, the system also checks for a possible regression, which, if confirmed, sends a message to ExclusiveGateway2.

If VN contradicts the resubmission process, the system passes the case to ExclusiveGateway4. Meanwhile, ExclusiveGateway2 also handles the message from the possible regression check, closing the process.

Upon receiving money, the system closes the case, and if a default period has expired, it redirects the process to ExclusiveGateway4.

In summary, the system follows a flow of tasks and gateways to handle a possible regression against VN, ensuring that the process is managed efficiently and effectively.
