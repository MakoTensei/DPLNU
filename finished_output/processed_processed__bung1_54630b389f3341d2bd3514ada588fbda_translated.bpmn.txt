 Upon receiving an order, the process begins with the 'Receive your order' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the packaging of goods. Once the packaging is complete, the goods are ready for dispatch, and the 'ParallelGateway5' is notified to proceed with the delivery.


The 'Determine delivery quantity' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' to ascertain the required quantity for the delivery. This information is then passed to the 'Quantity' task, which is responsible for preparing the goods for dispatch.


Simultaneously, the 'Insurance requirements' task is activated by 'ParallelGateway4' to check the insurance needs for the shipment. The outcome of this task is then passed to 'ParallelGateway5' to ensure that the insurance requirements are met before dispatch.


Once the quantity and insurance requirements are determined, the 'Add to Cart' task is initiated, which adds the goods to the customer's cart. This task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' and requires the delivery quantity to proceed.


The 'Appoint forwarding' task is then triggered by 'Add to Cart' to schedule the forwarding of the goods to the customer. This task is dependent on the delivery quantity and is also triggered by 'ParallelGateway4'.


Finally, the'ready for dispatch' event signifies that the goods are prepared for delivery. The 'ParallelGateway5' is notified to proceed with the dispatch, completing the end of the process.
