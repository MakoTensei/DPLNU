 A guest experiences hunger, triggering a sequence of events that lead to them ordering food. The order is then processed, and a Pieper is triggered to fulfill the order. Once the Pieper is retained, the guest is left with their food, and they eventually sit down to enjoy it.

The sequence of events is as follows:

1. The guest feels hungry, which initiates the 'Hunger' event.
2. The 'Hunger' event leads to the 'Get food' event, where the guest places an order.
3. The 'Guest will order' event triggers the 'Leave food' event, indicating that the guest has left their order.
4. The 'Guest will order' event also triggers the 'Waiting for Pieper' event, which waits for the Pieper to be ready.
5. The 'Pieper triggered' event occurs when the payment is made, and it leads to the 'Get food' event, indicating that the Pieper is now ready to deliver the food.
6. The 'Get food' event triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' event, which waits for 5 minutes before proceeding.
7. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' event triggers the 'Pieper Retained' event, indicating that the Pieper has been retained and is ready to deliver the food.
8. The 'Pieper Retained' event leads to the 'Guest has his food' event, where the guest receives their food.
9. The 'Guest has his food' event triggers the 'Sat' event, where the guest sits down to enjoy their meal.

The sequence of events is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0', which connects the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and 'Pieper Retained' events, ensuring that the Pieper is retained and the guest receives their food.
