 In a system designed to handle financial scoring requests and reporting, the following sequence of events and gateways are involved:

1. The process begins with the 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway forwards the request to the 'forward level2 results to frontend' task, which sends the results to the frontend.

2. The 'Schufa request\nReport' event triggers the 'forward delay' gateway. This gateway delays the process and forwards the request to the 'Determining Final Scoring Results (Level2)' task.

3. The 'Results are available?' gateway receives the 'Schufa request\nReport' event and forwards it to the'sid-93D5F8FD-B1FA-4941-BA67-3BC0153E9A13' task, which sends the results to the 'EndEvent0'. It also forwards the event to the 'forward delay' gateway.

4. The 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1' again, which forwards the request to the 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' tasks.

5. The 'Results received' gateway receives the 'Schufa.\nRequest\nsend' event and forwards it to the 'EndEvent0' task.

6. The 'Delay' gateway receives the 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event and forwards it to the 'EndEvent1' task.

7. The 'Results Level2 pardon' gateway receives the 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event and forwards it to the 'EndEvent1' task.

8. The 'EndEvent0' task receives the 'EventBasedGateway1' event and completes the process.

9. The 'EndEvent1' task receives the 'EventBasedGateway1' event and completes the process.

10. The 'EndEvent2' task receives the'sid-485D38A2-66EB-49EF-8BCA-42D3
