 The shipment process begins with the 'Shipment' event, which triggers the '3 offers' task, involving the 'ParallelGateway3'. Once the offers are selected, the 'Fill out Standard Package Ticket' task is initiated, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Following this, the 'Complete insurance' task is executed, which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Special delivery' task then takes place, involving the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2', and subsequently, the 'Packaging of goods' task is triggered, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Providing the goods' task follows, involving the 'ParallelGateway4', and finally, the 'Collection of goods' event concludes the process, with the 'ParallelGateway4' as its incoming gateway.
