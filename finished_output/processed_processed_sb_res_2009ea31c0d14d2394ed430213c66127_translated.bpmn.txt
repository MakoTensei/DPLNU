 When a customer enters the cashier system, they are prompted to enter their order. This process is initiated by the 'StartEvent0' and leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', where the cashier begins the transaction by accepting the customer's order, adjusting the Pieper, and providing the guest with their meal.

Once the order is processed, the cashier moves on to the 'EndEvent0', which signifies the completion of the transaction. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' is triggered, which involves the cashier informing the kitchen about the order and the guest about their meal.

After the meal is prepared, the 'Food is ready' event is triggered, and the cashier proceeds to the 'Sat' event, where they serve the meal to the guest. The 'Sat' event also triggers the 'Memory' event, which records the successful completion of the order.

In a separate scenario, when a customer's hunger is not applicable, they are prompted to place their meal in the mountains. This process starts with the 'StartEvent2' and leads to the 'Place meal in the mountains and inform A.' event, where the cashier places the meal in the designated area and informs the relevant personnel.

The 'EndEvent2' signifies the completion of the meal placement process.
