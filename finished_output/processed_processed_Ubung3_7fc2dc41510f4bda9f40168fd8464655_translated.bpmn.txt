 In the case management system, when a 'Regressive request' is received, it triggers the 'Case Regress' process, which checks the validity of the case and subsequently leads to the 'Case valid?' gateway. If the case is valid, the system proceeds to the 'VN payment request' process, which, upon receiving a 'Case valid?' signal, moves to the 'VN contradicts' process. This contradiction then leads to the 'Disclaimer Justified?' gateway. Concurrently, the 'VN contradicts' process also sends a 'Money received' signal to the 'EventBasedGateway2', which in turn closes the case. Additionally, if the case is valid, the 'Book the entrance' process is initiated upon receiving 'Money received', leading to the 'Close' process. Lastly, the 'Inspection' process is triggered when 'VN contradicts' is received, which then leads to the 'Disclaimer Justified?' process.
