 In the process of handling a report, the system first checks for any regression issues by examining incoming data. If a regression is possible, the system proceeds to the 'Reimbursement' task, which is triggered by the 'Regress possible?' event. Upon successful reimbursement, the system moves to the 'Book money' task, where the received money is recorded. This task concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event.

If no regression is found, the system closes the report, marking the end of the process with the 'Close' event.

In the case of a manufactured event, the system closes the report and marks the end of the process with the 'EndEvent1' event.

If a manufactured event is detected, the system then checks for any regress issues. If a regression is possible, the system proceeds to the 'EndEvent2' event.

For events related to a 'WV expired' situation, the system triggers the 'forward case' task, which leads to the 'EndEvent3' event.

Starting with the 'Report' event, the system can either close the report or proceed through a series of tasks and events based on the incoming data and the outcomes of the events. The process concludes with one of the 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', 'EndEvent2', or 'EndEvent3' events.
