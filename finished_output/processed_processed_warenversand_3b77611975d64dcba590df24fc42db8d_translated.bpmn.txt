 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the '3 offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4' and '3 offers' task. The '3 offers' task then leads to the 'Select your offer' task, which is connected to the 'Special shipment necessary?' event. This event is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Special shipment necessary?' event also leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Filling the package note' task is also connected to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' then leads to the 'Delivering goods' task, which is connected to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' is the final event in the process.

In summary, the process starts with sending goods, followed by offering options, examining the shipment quantity, filling the package note, and finally delivering the goods.
