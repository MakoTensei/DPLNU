 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nStart' event, which triggers the 'Start Schufascoring' task. This task initiates the scoring process and shares the delay with the 'Share delay' task.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' event kicks off the 'Scoring\nforward the result' task, which forwards the initial scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

As the scoring process progresses, the 'Scoring result\ndelays' event is generated, which triggers the 'perform scoring\n(1st level)' task. This task performs the initial scoring and sends the results to 'Scoring result\ndelays'.

The 'Scoring result\ndelays' event then triggers the 'perform scoring\n(2nd level)' task, which performs a second level of scoring and sends the results after some minutes.

The 'Scoring result\ndelays' event also triggers the 'Delay\nReport' task, which reports the delay and forwards the results to 'perform scoring\n(2nd level)'.

After some minutes, the'some\nminutes' event is generated, which triggers the 'Scoring\nforward the result' task again, forwarding the results to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Scoring result\ndetermined' event is then generated, which triggers the 'Scoring\nforward the result' task once more, forwarding the results to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Finally, the 'Scoring\ncompleted' event is generated, which signifies the completion of the scoring process and triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' task to complete the process.

In summary, the scoring process starts with the 'Schufascoring\nStart' event, which triggers a series of tasks to perform scoring, report delays, and forward results to the appropriate gateways until the 'Scoring\ncompleted' event signifies the completion of the process.
