 When a customer experiences hunger, they have several options to choose from, such as selecting their order, picking up food, or recording their order. The process begins with the customer feeling hungry, which triggers the 'Hunger' start event. From there, the customer can either choose to 'Add your order' by going to the 'Waiting to the row' gateway, or directly 'Pick up food' bypassing the ordering process.

If the customer decides to 'Add your order', they will be prompted to 'Enter your order' at the 'Recording' gateway. This step involves the customer providing their order details, which will be recorded and sent to the 'Cash and Pieper Set' event. The 'Koch inform' event then follows, informing the kitchen staff about the order.

Once the kitchen staff is informed, the 'Trigger Pieper' event is triggered, signaling the preparation of the meal. The customer is then notified to 'Leave food', which leads them to the 'Leave food' endpoint, where they can collect their meal.

Alternatively, if the customer chooses to 'Pick up food', they bypass the ordering process and go directly to the 'Pick up food' event. This event is triggered by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1' gateway, which is connected to the 'Hunger' start event.

In both scenarios, the customer's hunger is addressed, and they receive their meal. The process begins with the 'Hunger' start event and ends with the 'Leave food' endpoint, with various intermediary steps and gateways guiding the customer through their dining experience.
