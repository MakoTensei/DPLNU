 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph:

1. The process begins when a customer arrives at a restaurant feeling hungry. The system triggers the event'restaurant with Hunger' to initiate the order process.

2. The system then selects a court and prompts the customer to choose a seat. This event is represented by 'Select a court and\nput the customer in the row'.

3. Once the customer has been seated, the system prompts the customer to place their order. This event is represented by 'Add your order'.

4. The customer places their order, and the system processes it, leading to the event 'Order payment'.

5. After the order is paid for, the system proceeds to prepare the order. This event is represented by 'Order preparation'.

6. The order is then ready to be served, and the system triggers the event 'Pieper triggered'.

7. The system picks up the prepared Pieper and delivers it to the customer. This event is represented by 'Pick up Pieper'.

8. The customer receives the Pieper and finishes their meal. This event is represented by 'Customer finished'.

9. After the customer finishes their meal, the system triggers the event 'Food ready'.

10. The system then informs Koch about the completed order. This event is represented by 'Inform Koch about order'.

11. The system prepares to receive the next customer, and the process repeats with the event 'Order to receive'.

12. The process ends when the customer finishes their meal, represented by the event 'Customer finished'.

13. If the customer is still in the restaurant, the system triggers the event 'Famine' to indicate that the customer is still hungry.

14. The system also ends the process when the customer finishes their meal, represented by the event 'Order ready'.

15. Finally, the system transitions the customer to the next available court, represented by the event 'Ready for next Customers'.

This flow of events ensures a smooth and efficient dining experience for the customer, from placing the order to receiving the food and transitioning to the next customer.
