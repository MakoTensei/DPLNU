 In a seamless workflow, the system processes an 'Expiry request arrived' event, triggering the creation of a 'Schufaservice' request. This request is then edited, and the system sends delay information to the 'Request contacted' endpoint. Concurrently, an 'Order' event initiates the '1. Scoring' process, which is followed by the execution of a query. The 'Delay information snden' event leads to a 'Two. Scoring' process, resulting in the execution of two queries. Meanwhile, the 'Finished food' gateway remains inactive throughout this sequence.
