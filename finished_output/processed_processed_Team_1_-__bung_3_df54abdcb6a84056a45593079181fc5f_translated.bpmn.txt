 The process begins with the reception of a message indicating a possible regression against VN. This triggers the 'Send a message' task, which in turn sends a query to the 'Regress possible?' gateway. The 'Regress possible?' gateway, upon receiving the query, forwards the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then processes the query and sends a 'Process close' message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' further processes the query and sends a 'Process close' message to 'EventBasedGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Send a message' task also sends a 'Reimbursement' message to the 'Reimbursement\nSet' task. The 'Reimbursement\nSet' task, upon receiving the message, sends a 'Money report' to the 'Money\nReport' task.

The 'Money\nReport' task, in turn, sends a 'Process close' message to the 'Close' task. The 'Close' task, upon receiving the message, sends a 'Close' message to the 'Regress possible?' gateway.

Meanwhile, the 'Regress possible?' gateway, after processing the query, sends a 'Process close' message to 'EventBasedGateway3'. The 'EventBasedGateway3' processes the query and sends a 'Process close' message to 'Transfer from the collection' task.

The 'Transfer from the collection' task, after processing the query, sends a 'Close' message to the 'Close' task. The 'Close' task, upon receiving the message, sends a final 'Close' message, marking the end of the process.

If there is a 'Reimbursement period expired' event, the 'Reimbursement period expired' task sends a 'Close' message to the 'Close' task, marking the end of the process.
