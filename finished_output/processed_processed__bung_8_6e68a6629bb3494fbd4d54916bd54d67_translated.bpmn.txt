 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and conversational manner:

1. When a customer expresses hunger, they are placed on the line, and the system prompts them to select a restaurant.
2. Once the customer selects a restaurant, they are directed to the ExclusiveGateway0, where they can choose a meal.
3. The customer chooses a meal, and the system triggers Pieper to prepare the meal.
4. Pieper prepares the meal, and the system notifies the customer that the meal is ready.
5. The customer receives the meal and expresses their satisfaction, prompting Pieper to react.
6. Pieper's reaction triggers the system to inform the customer that their order has been completed.
7. The customer's hunger is satisfied, and the process ends.
