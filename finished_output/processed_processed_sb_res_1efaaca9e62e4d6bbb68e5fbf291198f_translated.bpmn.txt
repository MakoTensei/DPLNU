 The process begins with a customer expressing their hunger, which triggers the selection and ordering process. The customer places an order, which is not applicable in this scenario, and the order is outputted.

Next, the order is forwarded to the Pieper counter, where the customer waits for 5 minutes. During this time, the Pieper counter prepares the meal.

Once the meal is prepared, it is put into the reach, and the meal is marked as prepared. The customer is then served the food, and they eat it.

After eating, the customer is satisfied and decides to sit down. This marks the end of the process.

The entire process is managed by an Event-Based Gateway, which ensures that the correct events are triggered at the right time. The gateway starts with the 'Hungry' event and ends with the 'Sat' event.

In summary, the process involves the customer expressing hunger, placing an order, waiting for the meal to be prepared, being served the food, and finally sitting down. The Event-Based Gateway ensures that each step in the process is executed in the correct order.
