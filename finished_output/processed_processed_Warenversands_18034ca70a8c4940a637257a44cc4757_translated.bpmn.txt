 The process begins with a StartEvent0, which triggers the selection of freight forwarders for a special shipment with gross quantities. This leads to the 'Pick up offer at 3 freight forwarders' task, which requires the gross quantities of the shipment. Once the freight forwarders are selected, the process moves to the 'Insurance of goods required?' task, which checks if insurance is needed for the goods. If insurance is required, it proceeds to the 'Insurance close' task. Concurrently, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated to prepare the goods for shipment. After the goods are packaged, the 'Provide packaged goods for collection' task is executed, which marks the end of the process with EndEvent1. Throughout this process, the ParallelGateway2 and ParallelGateway3 gateways facilitate the flow of tasks and events.
