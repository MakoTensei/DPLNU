 When a frontend request is received, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the scoring request. The process begins at the ExclusiveGateway0, which receives the frontend request and forwards it to EventBasedGateway3. EventBasedGateway3 then triggers the creation of a Scoring Report.

Simultaneously, the Scoring 1 positive? event is triggered, which sends a notification to the ExclusiveGateway2. This event also initiates the 1. receive scoring task, which sends a Scoring Report to the Frontend request.

Once the Scoring Report is received, the Frontend request is marked as completed. The Scoring Request is also marked as completed, and the Scoring 1 positive? event sends a notification to the ExclusiveGateway2.

The ExclusiveGateway2 then completes the Scoring Request and sends a notification of delay if necessary. The 1. receive scoring task is also completed, and the Frontend request is marked as completed.

In summary, the sequence of events and tasks for processing a frontend request and scoring request is as follows:

1. Frontend request received at ExclusiveGateway0
2. Frontend request forwarded to EventBasedGateway3
3. EventBasedGateway3 triggers Scoring Report creation
4. Scoring 1 positive? event triggered, sending notification to ExclusiveGateway2
5. 1. receive scoring task initiated, sending Scoring Report to Frontend request
6. Frontend request completed
7. Scoring Request completed
8. Scoring 1 positive? event completes, sending notification to ExclusiveGateway2
9. ExclusiveGateway2 completes Scoring Request and sends delay notification if necessary
10. 1. receive scoring task completed
11. Frontend request completed
