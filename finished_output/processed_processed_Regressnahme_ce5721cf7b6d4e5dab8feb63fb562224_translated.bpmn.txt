 When a possible regression is detected, the system initiates a check on the case to investigate the issue further. If the case is found to be a possible regression, it is directed to ExclusiveGateway1, which then leads to the process for resubmission. This process involves setting up a payment receipt from the VN, which is then directed to ExclusiveGateway1. If the payment is refused, the system checks for opposition and if found, the process is closed. Conversely, if the payment is not justified, the process is also closed. Once the process is closed, it is marked as completed.
