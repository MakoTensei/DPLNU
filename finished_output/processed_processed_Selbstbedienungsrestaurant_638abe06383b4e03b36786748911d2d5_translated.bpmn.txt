 Let's describe the flow of tasks in a more natural and conversational flow, integrating the given tasks and gateways into a cohesive narrative:

1. The process begins when a guest experiences hunger, triggering the event 'Hunger'.
2. The guest places an order, which is received by the system, leading to the event 'Order to receive'.
3. The system selects a court to handle the order, choosing 'EventBasedGateway0'.
4. The order is then processed, and the guest is notified, resulting in the event 'Notification received'.
4. The guest appears, and the order is completed, leading to the event 'Order completed'.
5. The order is then picked up by a Pieper, who prepares the meal.
6. Once the meal is ready, the system notifies the employees, leading to the event 'Putting meal in vain'.
7. The employees complete the order, resulting in the event 'Order completed'.
8. The Pieper delivers the meal to the guest, and the guest is satisfied, ending the process.

Here's the flow with the tasks and gateways integrated:

1. Guest experiences hunger:
   - 'Hunger' event triggers the process.
   - The system selects 'EventBasedGateway0' to handle the order.

2. Guest places an order:
   - 'Order to receive' event is triggered.
   - 'EventBasedGateway0' receives the order and notifies the employees.

3. Employees prepare the meal:
   - 'Putting meal in vain' event is triggered.
   - The meal is ready, and the employees complete the order.

4. Pieper delivers the meal to the guest:
   - 'Order completed' event is triggered.
   - The guest is satisfied, and the process ends.

Note: The 'Pieper piept or\nName will be called' event is part of the 'Pieper' task flow and is not directly connected to the 'EventBasedGateway0'. However, it can be integrated into the narrative as follows:

5. Pieper prepares the meal and delivers it to
