 When goods are dispatched, a series of tasks and gateways are triggered to ensure the smooth transition of the shipment. The process begins with the 'Goods dispatched' start event, which initiates the 'Clarification of who takes over the shipment' task, aiming to determine if a large quantity is involved. This task connects to the 'Large quantities?' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'Goods dispatched' and 'freight forwarders commission' outgoing tasks.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods dispatched' start event also triggers the 'Package tickets filling' task, which is responsible for filling the necessary package tickets for the dispatched goods. This task connects to the 'Goods dispatched' gateway, leading to the 'Goods dispatched' outgoing task.

As the shipment progresses, the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway is activated, prompting the 'Insurance close' task to ensure that the insurance for the dispatched goods is completed. This task connects to the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, leading to the 'Insurance completed' outgoing task.

Additionally, the 'Goods dispatched' start event also initiates the 'Goods packaging' task, which is responsible for packaging the dispatched goods. This task connects to the 'Goods dispatched' gateway, leading to the 'Goods packaging' outgoing task.

In summary, the dispatch of goods triggers a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, ensuring that the shipment is properly managed, insured, and packaged, while also determining the necessary commission for freight forwarders.
