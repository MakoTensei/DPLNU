 The system initiates the scoring process with the 'Start Scoring request' task, triggered by the 'StartEvent0' event. This task has an outgoing connection to'sid-FF4BF6A5-15AA-406C-AD14-C7D59E746F2A'. Following this, the 'Testing of the message' task, which is triggered by 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', is executed and has an outgoing connection to 'EndEvent0'. This task is exclusively handled by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which also has incoming connections from 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent0' and'sid-8E3723D9-E307-4396-B20D-46D3FB83C1DC'.

The 'Scoring level 1' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', is processed by the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which has incoming connections from 'StartEvent1' and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent1' and'sid-7B115028-4F59-46A5-AFFD-13F9B3E7B6F6'. The 'Scoring level 2' task, triggered by'sid-5B652A6A-B223-4BD7-9138-8B7CE9FB1538', is processed by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which has incoming connections from'sid-5B652A6A-B223-4BD7-9138-8B7CE9FB1538' and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent2'. The 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', and 'EndEvent2' tasks are the final steps in their respective processes, with incoming connections from 'Testing of the message', 'Scoring level 1', and 'Scoring level 2' respectively, and no outgoing connections.
