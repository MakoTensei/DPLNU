 In a bustling event scenario, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then leads to the 'Create a package ticket' task, initiated by the 'big crowd?' incoming event. The 'Create a package ticket' task, in turn, connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' again.

Simultaneously, the 'big crowd?' event also triggers the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task, which is connected to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task, likewise, links back to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway3' receives the 'StartEvent0' and sends it to the 'Delivering goods' task, which concludes the process at the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process involves the 'StartEvent0' leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which connects to the 'Create a package ticket' and 'Choose the cheapest offer' tasks. The 'big crowd?' event also connects to the 'Specialist' task, which links back to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ParallelGateway3' receives the 'StartEvent0' and sends it to the 'Delivering goods' task, which ends the process at the 'EndEvent0'.
