 In a financial institution's credit scoring process, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure accurate and efficient scoring. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Send inquiry to Schufa' task. This task initiates a request to Schufa, a credit bureau, to gather necessary credit information.

Once the credit information is received, the 'Scoring result received' task is triggered, and the result is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then forwards the result to the 'Result (level 2) forward' task, which sends the result to the next level of processing.

The 'Result (level 2) forward' task triggers the 'Perform scoring (level 1)' task, which performs the initial scoring based on the received credit information. The 'Scoring result available?' task is then triggered, and it checks if the scoring is complete. If the scoring is complete, the 'Report the result to Bank' task is triggered, and the result is sent to the bank.

If the scoring is not complete, the 'Report delay' task is triggered, and the delay is reported to the relevant parties. The 'Perform scoring (level 2)' task is then triggered again to complete the scoring process.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway receives the 'Report the result to Bank' and 'StartEvent1' tasks, and it forwards the result to the 'Scoring performed' task. This task completes the scoring process and triggers the 'Scoring request' task, which sends a request for the final scoring result.

The 'Scoring request' task triggers the 'Follow-up' task, which follows up on the scoring process and ensures that the final result is received. The 'Scoring performed' task triggers the 'EndEvent' task, which marks the completion of the credit scoring process.

In summary, the credit scoring process involves a series of tasks and gateways that work together to gather credit information, perform scoring, and report the results to the bank. The process ensures that accurate and efficient credit scoring is achieved, ultimately helping the financial institution make informed lending decisions.
