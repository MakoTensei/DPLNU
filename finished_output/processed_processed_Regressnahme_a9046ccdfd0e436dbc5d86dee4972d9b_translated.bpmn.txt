 The process begins with a 'Regression check' event that triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle the incoming task. If the check passes, the process moves to the 'Send payment request to VN' task, which then leads to the 'Reimbursement period expired' event. This event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to handle the task, resulting in 'Money on debt collection'.

Alternatively, if the 'Regression check' fails, the process moves to the 'Close' task, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to handle the task, resulting in 'No money'.

In both scenarios, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' also handles the'money directly' task, which is triggered by the 'Regression check' event.

The 'EventBasedGateway4' is triggered by the 'Regression check' event and handles the 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider' task, which results in 'Money on debt collection'.

The 'Notification' event, triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway4', leads to the 'Close' task, which results in 'No money'.

Finally, the process ends with the 'No money' event, which has no outgoing tasks.
