 In a financial institution's credit scoring system, the process begins with the 'Communication Schufa' gateway, which receives a 'StartEvent0' and forwards it to the 'Scoring' gateway. The 'Scoring' gateway then processes the request and sends an 'EndEvent0' to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn triggers a 'Delay' event. Concurrently, the 'Scoring' gateway also sends an 'EndEvent0' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Meanwhile, the 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'StartEvent0' and sends it to the 'Delay' gateway, which then sends a'sid-04D5548B-B881-4C09-B880-A4ED9AFF8F8A' event. The 'Delay' gateway also sends an 'EndEvent0' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring' gateway sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Two. perform scoring' gateway, which then sends an 'EndEvent1' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the 'Scoring request' and 'EndEvent1' from the 'Scoring' gateway and sends an 'EndEvent1' to the '1. Conduct scoring (level 1)' gateway.

In summary, the credit scoring process involves multiple gateways and events, with the 'Communication Schufa' gateway initiating the process, the 'Scoring' gateway handling the scoring request, and the 'ExclusiveGateway0' coordinating the flow of events and ensuring the proper completion of the process.
