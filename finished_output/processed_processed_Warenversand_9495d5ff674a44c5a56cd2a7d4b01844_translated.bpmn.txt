 In the process of shipping goods, the workflow begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'Offer 1' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway7', which in turn leads to 'Select your offer'. Once the offer is selected, the process moves to 'Provide goods for collection' through 'ParallelGateway7'.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event also initiates the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task, which is linked to 'ParallelGateway7'. This task is followed by 'Packaging goods', which is connected to 'ParallelGateway7' as well.

Meanwhile, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event also triggers 'Offer 1' through 'ParallelGateway5', which then connects to 'ParallelGateway6'. 'Offer 1' is followed by 'Offer 2' and 'Offer 3', all of which are connected to 'ParallelGateway6'.

The 'Insurance necessary?' event, triggered by 'Big crowd?', leads to 'Complete insurance' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is then connected to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Filling the package note' task, triggered by 'Big crowd?', is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is followed by 'Specialist', which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Finally, 'Specialist' is connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to 'Provide goods for collection'.

In summary, the workflow for shipping goods involves multiple tasks and gateways, including 'Offer 1', 'Packaging goods', 'Clearing the shipping mode', 'Complete insurance', and 'Provide goods for collection'. These tasks are interconnected through various gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient process.
