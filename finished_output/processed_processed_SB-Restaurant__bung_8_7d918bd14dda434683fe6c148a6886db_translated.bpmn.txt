 When you feel hungry (Hunger), you decide to visit a restaurant. At the restaurant, you select a court (Select a court) and place your order (Order the Court). After waiting for a while, you receive your food (Pick up food). Once you've eaten, you're no longer hungry (Famine).

The process begins with the 'Hunger' event, which triggers the 'Pick up food' task. This task is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway0', which in turn leads to the 'Ordered' event. After placing your order, you wait for it to be processed (Order processed 23). This event is also connected to the 'EventBasedGateway0', which leads to the 'Ordered' event again.

Once your order is processed, you receive your food (providing meal), and you're no longer hungry (Famine). The 'Famine' event is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway0', which leads to the 'Ordered' event for the last time.

In summary, the process is as follows:

1. Feel hungry (Hunger)
2. Visit a restaurant and select a court (Select a court)
3. Place your order (Order the Court)
4. Wait for your order to be processed (Order processed 23)
5. Receive your food (Pick up food)
6. No longer feel hungry (Famine)
