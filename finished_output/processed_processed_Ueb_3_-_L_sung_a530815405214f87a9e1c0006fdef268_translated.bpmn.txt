 The process begins with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Check the case' task. This task checks if the regression possibility is right and, if so, it proceeds to the 'Regression procedure\nRight?' event.

If the regression possibility is confirmed, the 'Regression procedure\nRight?' event leads to the 'Send a message' task, which sets the process to WV. This task then connects to the 'Regression procedure\nhand over' event, which is triggered by the 'WV-Frist expired' event.

If the regression possibility is not confirmed, the 'Regression procedure\nRight?' event leads to the 'Close' task, which closes the case.

The 'Regression possibility\nReport' event also connects to the 'Payment' event, which is triggered by the 'Set process to WV' task. This event leads to the 'Book money receipt' task, which closes the case after receiving payment.

The 'Consultation' event, triggered by the 'Regression possibility\nRight?' event, leads to the 'Close' task, which closes the case.

The 'Regression possibility\nReport' event also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' event, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' event. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' event triggers the 'Regression procedure\nunsuccessful\nclosed' task if the regression procedure is unsuccessful.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' event, triggered by the 'Regression possibility\nRight?' event, leads to the 'Regression procedure\nsuccessful\ncompleted' task if the regression procedure is successful. This task also connects to the 'Payment' event, which closes the case after receiving payment.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' event also leads to the 'Consultation' event, which closes the case.

Lastly, the 'WV-Frist expired' event triggers the 'Regression procedure\nhand over' task, which closes the case.
