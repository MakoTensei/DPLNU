 Upon receiving a 'Notice of possible regression', the team initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, they check the case, which leads to an exclusive gateway, and subsequently, a payment request is sent to Vietnam.

The process concludes with the case being closed and the debt collection being commissioned.
