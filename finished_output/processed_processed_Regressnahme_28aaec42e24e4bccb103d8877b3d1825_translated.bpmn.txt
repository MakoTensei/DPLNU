 Upon receiving the report that Vietnam will be in regression, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the situation. First, a payment request is sent to Vietnam to handle the regressed case. Concurrently, the system checks if there's a possibility of regression, which leads to a decision point. If the regression is justified, the process is closed, and the event ends. If not, the system proceeds to set up a resubmission process.


The resubmission process is then activated, and the system prepares to send the money report. This report is crucial for the resubmission process, and it triggers an exclusive gateway that connects to the inkasso-dl for further action.


Meanwhile, the system also monitors for any reproach from Vietnam, which would lead to another decision point. If reproach is found, the process is directed to another exclusive gateway, which eventually leads to the end of the event.


As the process unfolds, the system keeps track of the events and their outcomes, ensuring that each step is followed correctly and that the necessary actions are taken based on the incoming data. The sequence concludes with the end of the event, either after successfully handling the regressed case or after addressing the reproach.
