 The Secretariat clarifies who takes delivery, starting with the ParallelGateway4. They then obtain offers from three forwardings, which is triggered by the StartEvent0. Once the offers are obtained, the Secretariat selects a forwarding, which leads to ExclusiveGateway3. The Secretariat fills a standardized parcel note, which also goes through ExclusiveGateway2. If insurance is required, the logistics manager closes it, and this decision is made at ExclusiveGateway2. Meanwhile, warehouse workers are packaged in parallel at ParallelGateway4, which then sends them to ParallelGateway5. The selected forwarding, ExclusiveGateway3, clears the shipping mode and sends the package to ParallelGateway5. Finally, the product is ready for shipping and is sent to Delivery through ParallelGateway5.
