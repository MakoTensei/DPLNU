 In the case of a 'Regression possibility\nReport', the process begins with the task 'Check the case' (sid-5200F67B-6F1E-45A5-98DE-63985BD63DBE) which checks for any regression possibilities. This task then leads to the 'Send payment request' (sid-3C588FCC-C540-4317-8AF2-979A9E4F32CC) as the next step.

Following this, if the 'Regression possibility\nReport' indicates a regression, the process moves to the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway (sid-CA768F25-A357-4D26-813F-5B42DE8F5C40). This gateway has two outgoing paths: 'Process\ncompleted' (sid-488445C8-9A7A-4F6E-8A12-3FB9F4883867) and 'Set process for resubmission' (sid-3FCA7D7D-1863-4A57-B6E7-ED3790FD4142).

If the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway leads to 'Process\ncompleted', the process is finalized. However, if it leads to 'Set process for resubmission', the process continues with the 'Set process for resubmission' task (sid-3C588FCC-C540-4317-8AF2-979A9E4F32CC), which then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-0BB16A93-15BC-41B1-98DE-6CEB4FFCB384) with an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3' (sid-246899A4-23A7-4BC7-BDAA-0000A7C1D4D2).
