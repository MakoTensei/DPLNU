 The process begins with the 'Preparation\nShipment' event, which triggers the 'Determining the shipping mode' task, receiving input from 'Type of shipping?' and directing the flow to 'InclusiveGateway2'. Once the shipping mode is determined, the 'Pick up offers of three forwardings' task is initiated, taking input from 'Type of shipping?' and leading to 'Select your offer'. This task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn provides the 'Packaged\nand shipping cleared' status, allowing the 'Provide goods for collection' task to proceed. This task, after receiving the 'Packaged\nand shipping cleared' status, results in the 'Goods\nPickup ready' event, marking the end of the process.


Here's the flow described in a more natural and understandable flow:

1. The process starts with the 'Preparation\nShipment' event.
2. The 'Determining the shipping mode' task is triggered, taking input from 'Type of shipping?' and directing the flow to 'InclusiveGateway2'.
3. The 'Pick up offers of three forwardings' task is initiated, also taking input from 'Type of shipping?' and leading to 'Select your offer'.
4. 'Select your offer' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which provides the 'Packaged\nand shipping cleared' status.
5. The 'Provide goods for collection' task receives the 'Packaged\nand shipping cleared' status and results in the 'Goods\nPickup ready' event, marking the end of the process.
