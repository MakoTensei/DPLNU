 Let's describe the flow of tasks in a natural paragraph format:

1. The process begins with the event 'Hunger\nNot applicable', where the user expresses hunger but no specific order is mentioned. This triggers the task 'Add your order', which is initiated by the gateway 'EventBasedGateway0'.

2. The user then selects a court from the available options, which leads to the task 'Deliver food'. This task is triggered by the gateway 'EventBasedGateway0' and is dependent on the completion of 'Add your order'.

3. The user receives an order, which is the event 'Order\nreceived'. This event triggers the task 'inform about completion', which is initiated by the gateway 'EventBasedGateway0'.

4. The order is completed, and the event 'Order\nfinished' is triggered. This event is dependent on the completion of 'inform about completion' and is initiated by the gateway 'EventBasedGateway0'.

5. The process ends with the event 'Famine', which is triggered by the task 'Eat meal' and is dependent on the completion of 'Deliver food'. The user's hunger is satisfied, and the process concludes.

In summary, the user expresses hunger, selects a court, receives an order, and completes the order, leading to the satisfaction of their hunger. The process is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0', which coordinates the flow of tasks based on the completion of previous tasks.
