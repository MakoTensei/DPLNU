 In a system designed to process financial inquiries and scoring reports, the following sequence of events and interactions occur:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Results Level 1 Report' task, which generates a report based on the initial inquiry.

2. Upon obtaining the 'Delay message\nobtained', the 'Report delay' task is initiated, which then leads to the 'Get scoring result Level 2' task.

3. The 'Get scoring result Level 2' task, in turn, triggers the 'Results Level 2 report' task, which generates a report based on the scoring results.

4. The 'StartEvent1' event initiates the 'Run scoring level 1' task, which produces a 'Scoring result\nLevel 1\nobtained' report.

5. The 'Run scoring level 1' task then transitions to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which decides the next course of action based on the scoring results.

6. If the scoring results are available, the 'Result?' task is triggered, leading to the 'Results Level 2 report' task, which generates a report based on the scoring results.

7. If the scoring results are not available, the 'Result?' task leads to the 'Finished' task, marking the end of the process.

8. The 'Result?' task also triggers the 'Result\nReport' task, which generates a report based on the available scoring results.

9. The 'Result\nReport' task can be triggered by either the 'Result?', 'Finished', or 'Delay message\nobtained' tasks, depending on the flow of the process.

10. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which is triggered by the 'Run scoring level 1' task, has two outgoing paths: 'Result\nReport' and 'Results Level 2 report'.

11. The 'Result\nReport' task can be triggered by the 'Result?', 'Finished', or 'Delay message\nobtained' tasks, while the 'Results Level 2 report' task is triggered by the 'Get scoring result Level 2' task.
