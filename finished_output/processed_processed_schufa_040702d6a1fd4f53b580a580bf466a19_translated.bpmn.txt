 When a scoring request is initiated, it triggers a sequence of events and interactions between various components in the system. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which sends a 'Report scoring to Frontend' message to the 'Responsibility\nScoring' gateway. This gateway, upon receiving the request, sends an 'expect response' message back to the 'StartEvent0'.

Once the 'expect response' message is received, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway processes the request and sends an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'Responsibility\nScoring' gateway. Simultaneously, it also sends a 'Send a waiting message to Frontend' message to the 'Frontend' component.

The 'Frontend' component, upon receiving the 'Send a waiting message to Frontend' message, awaits a response from the 'Responsibility\nScoring' gateway. Once the response is received, the 'Responsibility\nScoring' gateway sends an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and an 'Expect response' message back to the 'StartEvent0'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends an 'EndEvent0' message to the 'StartEvent0' and a 'Send scoring result' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2', upon receiving the 'Send scoring result' message, sends an 'EndEvent1' message to the 'StartEvent1' and a 'Send scoring result' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Finally, the 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends an 'EndEvent1' message to the 'StartEvent1' and awaits a response from the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Once the response is received, the process concludes, and the scoring result is reported back to the 'Frontend'.
