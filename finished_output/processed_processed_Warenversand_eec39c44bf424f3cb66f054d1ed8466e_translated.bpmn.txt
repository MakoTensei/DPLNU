 The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent', which triggers the 'Pick up offers with three freight forwarders' task. This task requires the 'Type of shipping?' input, which is provided by the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. The task then leads to the 'Select a quote' task, which also requires the 'Type of shipping?' input from the same gateway. The 'Select a quote' task connects to the 'Specialist' task, which in turn requires the 'Type of shipping?' input from the 'Type of shipping?' gateway.

Simultaneously, the 'Pick up offers with three freight forwarders' task also connects to the 'Filling standard package voucher' task, which requires the 'Type of shipping?' input from the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. This task leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, requiring the 'Insurance necessary?' input from the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway.

The 'Filling standard package voucher' task also connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' task, which requires the 'Insurance necessary?' input from the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway.

The 'Pick up offers with three freight forwarders' task connects to the 'Goods pickup ready' task, which requires the 'ParallelGateway5' input.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways that involve selecting a shipping method, choosing a quote, and completing insurance. The process ends with the 'Goods pickup ready' event, which is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway5' task.
