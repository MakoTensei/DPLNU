 In the bustling world of logistics, a series of tasks unfold, each with its own set of incoming and outgoing connections, orchestrated through a network of gateways.


The process begins with a request for goods, which triggers the 'Goods requested' event. This event initiates the packaging process, with 'Packaging goods' task (ID: sid-B17D771A-1CB5-4A8F-B308-517D733828EB) taking charge.
