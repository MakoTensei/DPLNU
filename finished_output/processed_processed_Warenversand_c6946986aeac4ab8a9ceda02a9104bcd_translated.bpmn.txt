 Upon receiving an order to receive, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to ensure the order is processed correctly. The process begins with the 'Order to receive' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the order. This gateway checks if a special shipment is necessary, which is determined by the 'Special shipment necessary?' gateways. If a special shipment is required, the system routes the order to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then connects to 'ParallelGateway6' for further processing.


If the order does not require a special shipment, the system proceeds to 'Insurance necessary?' to determine if insurance is needed. If insurance is necessary, the order is directed to 'ParallelGateway6' through 'ExclusiveGateway1'.


Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway4' is responsible for packaging the goods. It receives the order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway6' for further processing.


Once the order is ready for collection, the system sends it to 'Provide goods for collection' through 'ParallelGateway7', which then concludes the process by marking the order as 'Order processed 23'.


In summary, the order processing flow is as follows:

1. 'Order to receive' event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
2. 'ExclusiveGateway2' checks for special shipment necessity and routes to 'ParallelGateway6' or 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
3. If insurance is needed, 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the order to 'ParallelGateway6'.
4. 'ParallelGateway4' packages the goods and sends them to 'ParallelGateway6'.
5. 'Provide goods for collection' through 'ParallelGateway7' marks the order as 'Order processed 23'.
