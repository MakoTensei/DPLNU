 When an order to receive is initiated, the process begins with Clearing the shipping mode, which ensures that the necessary arrangements for shipping are in place. This task is connected to the Special shipment required? gateway, which in turn leads to the ExclusiveGateway2. From there, the process continues with Filling the package note, also connected to the Special shipment required? gateway, and again to ExclusiveGateway2. This gateway then leads to Goods ready for dispatch.

Simultaneously, the order to receive triggers the task of Completing insurance. This task is linked to the Insurance necessary? gateway, which connects to ExclusiveGateway3. This gateway then leads to ParallelGateway5, which finally results in Goods ready for dispatch.

In summary, the order to receive triggers a series of tasks and gateways that ensure the necessary arrangements for shipping and insurance are in place, leading to the final stage of Goods ready for dispatch.
