 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the selection of three freight forwarders to handle the incoming goods. This task is initiated by the 'Big crowd?' event, which leads to the 'Select a range of three freight forwarders' task. The cheapest offer among the freight forwarders is then chosen, which is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' event as well.

Following the selection of the cheapest offer, a specialist is consulted to determine if insurance is necessary for the goods. This consultation is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' event and leads to the 'Insurance necessary?' task. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is initiated, which is also triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' event.

Once the goods are packaged, they are sent for collection. This task is triggered by the 'Provide packaged goods for collection' event, which is initiated by the 'Packaging goods' task. The packaged goods are then sent to the 'ParallelGateway4' for further processing.

The 'ParallelGateway4' receives the packaged goods and sends them to the 'EndEvent0' task, which signifies the completion of the process. The 'EndEvent0' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway4' and is the final step in the process.
