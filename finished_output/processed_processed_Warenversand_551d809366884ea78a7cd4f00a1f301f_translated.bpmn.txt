 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'triggering normal mail delivery' task, which requires the 'fill out standard package voucher' task to be completed. This task then sends the 'Lot?' to the 'Lot?' gateway, which in turn connects to the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ParallelGateway3' connects to the 'Packaging goods' task, which sends the 'ParallelGateway4' to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task then connects to the 'Selection of freight forwarders' task, which sends the 'ParallelGateway4' to the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway. The 'ParallelGateway4' then connects to the 'Insurance close' task, which sends the 'ParallelGateway4' to the 'Provide goods for collection' task. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task connects to the 'EndEvent0', completing the process.
