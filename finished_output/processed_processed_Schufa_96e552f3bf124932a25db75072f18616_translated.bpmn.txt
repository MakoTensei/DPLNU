 When a Schufa scoring request is received, the process begins with the 'Schufascoring requested' start event, which triggers the forwarding of the result to the credit award frontend. This is followed by the 'Schufascoring request has been received' event, which initiates the sending of a reply. The scoring process then proceeds through two levels of determination, with the 'Value determined?' gateways acting as checkpoints. Once the value is determined, the 'EndEvent1' is triggered, leading to the editing of the request. If there is a delay in the process, the 'Report delay' event is triggered, which in turn leads to the 'Determining scoring (level 2)' event. Finally, the 'Request edited' end event concludes the process.
