 Let's start the court selection process:

1. The customer feels hungry and decides to place an order.
2. The customer selects a court and is placed in the row.
3. The customer adds their order to the system.
4. The system prepares the order and informs the customer that the food will be ready in 5 minutes.
5. The customer receives the food and it's ready to be served.
6. The customer is notified that the meal is prepared and ready to be eaten.
7. The customer finishes eating and the order is completed.

Here's the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive way:

1. The customer feels hungry and decides to place an order.
2. The customer selects a court and is seated in the row.
3. The customer adds their order to the system.
4. The system prepares the order and informs the customer that the food will be ready in 5 minutes.
5. The customer receives the food, which is now ready to be served.
6. The customer is notified that the meal is prepared and ready to be eaten.
7. The customer finishes eating and the order is completed.
