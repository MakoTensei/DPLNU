 In a system with various components, the 'StartEvent0' initiates the process, leading to the 'Delay?' gateway, which receives the 'Scoring response obtained' from the 'Scoring response obtained' start event. This triggers the 'Delay?' gateway to send 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent0' to their respective outgoing paths. Concurrently, the 'Delay?' gateway also sends 'Delay View' to the 'Delay View' task, which in turn sends 'EndEvent0' to its outgoing path.

Meanwhile, the 'Delay View' task, upon receiving 'Delay?', sends 'EndEvent0' to its outgoing path. The 'Delay View' task also sends 'Delay View' to the 'Delay View' task, which sends 'EndEvent0' to its outgoing path.

The 'Scoring response obtained' task, upon receiving 'Scoring response obtained', sends 'Score (level 2)' to the 'Score (level 2)' task, which sends 'EndEvent1' to its outgoing path. Simultaneously, the 'Score (level 2)' task sends'successful?' to the'successful?' gateway, which in turn sends 'EndEvent1' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' to their respective outgoing paths.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway, upon receiving'successful?', sends 'EndEvent1' to its outgoing path. It also receives 'Score (level 2)' from the 'Score (level 2)' task and sends 'EndEvent1' to its outgoing path.

The 'StartEvent1' initiates the process, leading to the'successful?' gateway, which receives'successful?' from the'successful?' start event. This triggers the'successful?' gateway to send 'EndEvent1' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' to their respective outgoing paths.

In summary, the system starts with 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1', which lead to the respective 'Delay?','successful?', and 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateways. The 'Delay?' gateway sends 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent0' to their respective outgoing paths, while the'successful?' gateway
