 In a complex workflow involving various tasks, gateways, and events, the following sequence of actions can be described:

1. A 'Regression report' is generated and sent to the 'is Regress authorized?' gateway.
2. The 'is Regress authorized?' gateway checks if the regression is authorized. If authorized, it proceeds to the 'Check regression' task and sends a 'Closed\n' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If not authorized, it sends a 'Closed\n' message to the 'EndEvent1'.
3. The 'Check regression' task receives the 'Regression report' and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
4. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Regression report' and checks if the regression is authorized. If authorized, it proceeds to the 'Booked entry' task and sends an 'Incoming payment' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If not authorized, it sends a 'Close' message to the 'EndEvent1'.
5. The 'Booked entry' task receives the 'Incoming payment' message and proceeds to the 'Set on re-submission' task.
6. The 'Set on re-submission' task receives the 'Incoming payment' message and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
7. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Incoming payment' message and sends it to the 'Incoming payment' gateway.
8. The 'Incoming payment' gateway receives the 'Incoming payment' message and sends it to the 'Set on re-submission' task.
9. The 'Set on re-submission' task receives the 'Incoming payment' message and sends it to the 'Objection justified?' gateway.
10. The 'Objection justified?' gateway receives the 'Set on re-submission' message and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'EndEvent1' gateways.
11. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Set on re-submission' message and sends it to the 'Proceedings' task.
12. The 'Proceedings' task
