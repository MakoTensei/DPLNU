 The workflow begins with the 'Schufascoring Inquiry' initiated by the 'Starts scoring' task, which triggers the 'Get delay message' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Guide scoring through' message to the 'Guide scoring through' task, which in turn leads to the 'Results arrived' event. The 'Results arrived' event connects to the 'Guide other actions through' gateway, which sends a 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' message to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task. This task then guides the process to the 'EndEvent2' event, which is triggered by the 'can work immediately?' inquiry. Finally, the 'EndEvent2' event connects to the 'EndEvent3' event, which is also triggered by the 'can work immediately?' inquiry.
