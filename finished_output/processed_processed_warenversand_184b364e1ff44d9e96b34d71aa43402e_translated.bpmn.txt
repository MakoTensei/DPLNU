 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which has two outgoing paths: 'Check insurance' and 'Select your offer'. The 'Check insurance' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', while 'Select your offer' leads to a 'Specialist'. Both tasks from 'ExclusiveGateway0' eventually converge at 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Select your offer' task connects to a 'Specialist', which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Check insurance' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. From 'ExclusiveGateway2', the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which also leads to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Filling the package note' task leads to 'Packaging goods' task, which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Finally, the 'Delivering goods' task, which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to 'Filling the package note', which then branches out to 'Check insurance' and 'Select your offer'. Both tasks converge at 'ExclusiveGateway2', where 'Complete insurance' and 'Packaging goods' tasks are triggered. The process concludes with 'Delivering goods' leading to 'EndEvent0'.
