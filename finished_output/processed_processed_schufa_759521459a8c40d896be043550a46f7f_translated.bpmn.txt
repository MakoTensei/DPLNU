 The workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Score determined?' gateway, which then leads to the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway sends the 'Score get' task to the 'Score get' gateway, which in turn shares the score with the 'Share Score' gateway. Concurrently, the 'Score determined?' gateway also sends the 'Share Score' task to the 'Share Score' gateway.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Level 1\nperform' task initiates the 'ParallelGateway3', which sends the 'Share Score' and 'Share delay' tasks to the 'Share Score' and 'Share delay' gateways, respectively. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task also sends the 'Share Score' task to the 'Share Score' gateway.

The 'Score get' task, after receiving the score, sends the 'Share Score' task to the 'Share Score' gateway. The 'Share Score' gateway then sends the score to the 'Staff' gateway, which in turn sends the 'Staff' task to the 'Staff' endpoint.

The 'Score get' task also sends the 'Share Score' task to the 'Share Score' gateway, which then sends the score to the 'Share Score' endpoint.

Finally, the 'Score get' task sends the 'Share Score' task to the 'Share Score' gateway, which then sends the score to the 'Share Score' endpoint. The 'Share Score' task is also sent to the 'Share Score' gateway, which then sends the score to the 'Share Score' endpoint.

The 'Share Score' task is also sent to the 'Share Score' gateway, which then sends the score to the 'Share Score' endpoint. The 'Share Score' task is also sent to the 'Share Score' gateway, which then sends the score to the 'Share Score' endpoint.

The 'Share Score' task is also sent to the 'Share Score' gateway, which then sends the score to the 'Share Score' endpoint. The 'Sh
