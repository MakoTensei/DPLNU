 When a shipment is required, the process begins with the 'Shipment Required' event, which triggers the 'Packaging Goods' task through the 'ParallelGateway2'. This task is then followed by the 'Pick up three offers' task, which is also initiated by 'ParallelGateway2'. Once the offers are picked up, the 'Select your offer' task is triggered, which in turn initiates the 'Filling the Package Note' task through 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Filling the Package Note' task is then followed by the 'Specialist' task, which is initiated by 'Lot?'. The 'Specialist' task is then followed by the 'Complete Insurance' task, which is triggered by 'Insurance?'. Finally, the 'Goods Pickup Made Available' event is triggered, which signifies the end of the process.
