 The following tasks and gateways are part of a system that handles various events and processes:

1. When a "Regression" report is received, it triggers a check for possible regression. If a regression is possible, the system will process the VN payment request.

2. The VN payment request is then processed on the counter, and if a regression is possible, it will lead to an intermediate event, "IntermediateCatchEvent3," which will eventually result in a handover to the debtor.

3. If a "Regression" report is received, it also triggers an event based on the EventBasedGateway2, which can lead to an opposition being justified or an intermediate event, "IntermediateCatchEvent5," which will also result in a handover to the debtor.

4. When the "Reimbursement period expired" event occurs, it triggers a handover to the debtor.

5. When money is received, it triggers a close event, and if a regression is possible, it will lead to an intermediate event, "IntermediateCatchEvent3," which will eventually result in a handover to the debtor.

6. The "Regression possible?" event triggers a handover to the debtor and a close event.

7. The "Opposition justified" event is triggered by the EventBasedGateway2 and leads to a handover to the debtor.

8. The "EventBasedGateway2" event is triggered by the "Regression possible?" event and can lead to an intermediate event, "IntermediateCatchEvent3," an opposition being justified, or an intermediate event, "IntermediateCatchEvent5."

9. The "IntermediateCatchEvent3" event is triggered by the "Process on the counter" event and leads to a close event.

10. The "IntermediateCatchEvent5" event is triggered by the "Regression possible?" event and leads to a handover to the debtor.

The system starts with a "Report\nRegression" event, which can lead to various outcomes based on the incoming and outgoing events. The system ends with a "Close" event, which can be triggered by multiple events, including "Regression possible?" and "IntermediateC
