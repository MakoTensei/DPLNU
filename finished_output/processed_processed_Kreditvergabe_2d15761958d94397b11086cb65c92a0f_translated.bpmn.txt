 The scoring process begins with the "Start\nScoring\n(level 1)" task, which is triggered by the "Start\nSchufascoring\nProcess" event. This task is directed towards the "ExclusiveGateway0", which then forwards the task to "sid-65F78B37-3EC9-48B5-8C84-561802046F9D" for level 1 scoring. Upon completion of level 1 scoring, the task is forwarded to "sid-712532D4-7D4B-4637-9912-C9FEF920D8BC" for level 2 scoring.

The level 1 scoring results are then sent to "EventBasedGateway1", which in turn forwards the results to "sid-0893D8FF-7A98-4E8D-8EA5-9C7B521DA48D" for the "Welcome\nScoring results (Level 1)" event.

The level 2 scoring results are sent to "EventBasedGateway1" as well, which forwards them to "sid-C9973BC1-FE02-4B44-92E8-FEFF5123B0DC" for the "Welcome\nScoring results (level 2)" event.

Finally, the entire scoring process concludes with the "Scoring request\nFinished" event, which is triggered by the completion of both level 1 and level 2 scoring tasks. This event does not have any outgoing connections.
