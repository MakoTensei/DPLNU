 The process begins with the 'Start Schufa scoring process' task, which triggers the 'StartEvent0'. This event then leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', which is the first step in the scoring process. After this, the process moves to 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task, initiated by 'StartEvent1'. This task sends a message to the bank for delay and also triggers 'Delay?', which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then handles the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' and 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' tasks, which are both outcomes of the 'Delay?' event. Once these tasks are completed, the process moves to 'forward scoring results', which is triggered by 'EventBasedGateway3'. This task is the final step in the scoring process and leads to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', which leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. Then, 'StartEvent1' triggers 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' and 'Delay?', which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. 'ExclusiveGateway2' handles the scoring tasks and finally leads to 'forward scoring results' and 'EndEvent0'.
