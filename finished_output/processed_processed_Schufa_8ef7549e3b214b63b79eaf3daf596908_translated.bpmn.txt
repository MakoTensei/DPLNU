 In the scoring process, a request for scoring is initiated, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The process begins with the 'Scoring is required' start event, which leads to the 'Scoring request' task. This task has two outgoing paths: one to the 'Sending result' task and another to the 'Delay?' gateway.

If the scoring is successful, the 'Scoring works the first time' task is triggered, which sends the results to the 'Results obtained' task and also sends the process to the 'End process' gateway.

However, if the scoring is not successful, the 'Delay?' gateway is triggered. This gateway has two outgoing paths: one to the 'Sending result' task and another to the 'EndEvent1' gateway.

The 'Sending result' task sends the results to the 'Scoring Report result' task, which then sends the results to the 'End process' gateway.

The 'EndEvent1' gateway sends the process to the 'End process' gateway.

In summary, the scoring process starts with a request, followed by a series of tasks and gateways that handle the scoring and results. The process can either end successfully or be delayed, depending on the outcome of the scoring.
