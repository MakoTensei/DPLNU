 In a system with various tasks, gateways, start events, and end events, the following workflow can be described:

Starting with the 'StartEvent0', the system initiates the 'Send request' task, which then triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. This event leads to the 'View result' task, which in turn results in the 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Share delay' task, which leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. This event then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which ultimately results in the 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Test\nLevel 1' task, which leads to the 'final okay?' task. This task concludes with the 'final\nResult' task.

Lastly, 'Test\nConduct Level 2' task is triggered by'sid-47120969-E9F8-4F13-A44E-90EBCD26399E'. This task results in the 'EndEvent2'.

In summary, the system starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers multiple tasks and gateways, leading to various outcomes and end events.
