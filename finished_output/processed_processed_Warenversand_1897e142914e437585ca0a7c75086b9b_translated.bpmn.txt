 When a ship request is initiated, the process begins with determining the quantity needed, which is then passed to ParallelGateway3. From there, the task of picking up offers is carried out, leading to the selection of a freight forwarder. This selection is communicated to ExclusiveGateway0, which in turn directs the process to ExclusiveGateway2 for ordering the selected freight forwarder.


Once the freight forwarder is ordered, the process moves to filling a standard package voucher, which is also routed through ExclusiveGateway0 to ExclusiveGateway2. Following this, a decision on insurance liability is made, which is again passed through ExclusiveGateway0 to ExclusiveGateway2.


With the insurance decision made, the process proceeds to complete the insurance, which is directed to ExclusiveGateway1 and subsequently to ExclusiveGateway2. After the insurance is completed, the goods are packaged, and this task is sent to ParallelGateway3, which then routes the packaged goods to ParallelGateway4.


Finally, the provision for collection is made, which is received at ExclusiveGateway1 and leads to the end of the process.
