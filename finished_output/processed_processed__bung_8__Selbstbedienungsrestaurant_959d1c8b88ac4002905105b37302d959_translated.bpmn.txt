 A customer, feeling hungry, enters a restaurant and places an order for a meal. The restaurant's system tracks the customer's hunger and presents a selection of courts to choose from. The customer selects a court, and their order is processed.

The customer then proceeds to a row, where they wait for their court to be served. Once in line, the customer's hunger is tracked, and they are served their meal. The meal, which contains a Pieper, is then triggered, and the customer's hunger is satisfied.

The restaurant's system adds the order to its system, and the cashier processes the payment. The Pieper is set, and the customer's order is over. The restaurant's kitchen informs the chef about the order, and the chef prepares the meal.

The prepared meal is placed in the reach, and the customer is ready to enjoy their food. After finishing their meal, the customer leaves the restaurant, and the system marks the end of the event.
