 Upon receiving a regression report, the process is initiated to check the case, which involves communication with ExclusiveGateway1. If the case is justified, the process moves to ExclusiveGateway4, where it determines the tax payable by the debtor. Conversely, if the case is not justified, the process is closed.


When a conversation with VN is initiated, the process diverges to ExclusiveGateway1, which can either send a payment request or determine the number of days required for a reforestation project. If the conversation is related to a justified case, the process proceeds to ExclusiveGateway4 to assess the tax payable by the debtor.


If a payment request is needed, the process is routed to ExclusiveGateway6, which then closes the process. In the case of a justified case, the process is also closed.


For cases that require reforestation, the process goes to ExclusiveGateway8, which then directs the process to ExclusiveGateway5, resulting in the process being closed.


When the case is justified, the process is closed after ExclusiveGateway4. If the case is not justified, the process is closed after ExclusiveGateway1.


The process begins with the reception of a regression report, which triggers a check on the case through ExclusiveGateway1. If the case is justified, the process moves to ExclusiveGateway4 to determine the tax payable by the debtor. If the case is not justified, the process is closed after ExclusiveGateway1.
