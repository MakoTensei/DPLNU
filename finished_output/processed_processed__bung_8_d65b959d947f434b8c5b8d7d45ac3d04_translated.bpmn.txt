 Let's describe the process in a more natural flow:

1. A customer named "Hungriger the" places an order, triggering the event "Hungriger the".
2. The system receives the order and sends a message to "Add your order", which connects to the "Court of Justice".
3. The "Court of Justice" acknowledges the order and sends a message to "Retrieve customers", which connects to the "EventBasedGateway0".
4. "EventBasedGateway0" waits for the preparation of the meal and sends a message to "Customer will appear", which connects to "EndEvent1".
5. Once the meal is ready, the "Court of Justice" sends a message to "Trigger Pieper", which waits for 5 minutes.
6. After 5 minutes, "Trigger Pieper" sends a message to "EndEvent1", signaling the completion of the order process.
7. The "Court of Justice" then sends a message to "Hand over meal", which connects to "EndEvent1".
8. Finally, the meal is handed over to the customer, and the process concludes with "EndEvent1".
