 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and understandable manner:

1. When someone feels hungry, an event named "Feeling hungry" is triggered. This event initiates the process by sending a signal to "IntermediateCatchEvent2".

2. "IntermediateCatchEvent2" captures the hunger signal and sends it to "ExclusiveGateway0". This gateway then sets a timer for 5 minutes.

3. During the 5-minute waiting period, an order is obtained, which triggers the "Order\nobtained" event. This event sends a signal to "ExclusiveGateway0" again, which continues the 5-minute timer.

4. Once the 5 minutes are up, "ExclusiveGateway0" sends the signal to "IntermediateCatchEvent5", which completes the process and sends a signal to "Process\ncompleted".

5. "IntermediateCatchEvent5" also sends a signal to "meal ready", indicating that the meal is prepared and ready to be served.

6. The "meal ready" event triggers the "Pieper\nobtained" event, which sends a signal to "Hunger\ndistilled". This event represents the satisfaction of hunger and the completion of the meal process.

7. Finally, the "Process\ncompleted" event signifies the end of the meal preparation and distribution process.
