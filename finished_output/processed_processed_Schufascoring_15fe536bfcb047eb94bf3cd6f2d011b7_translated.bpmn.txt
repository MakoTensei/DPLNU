 The process begins with a 'Scoring request' from 'The Bank' (sid-FECB65C0-A5D4-4EBC-A6D2-BBB36A795A87). This request triggers a series of events and interactions between different gateways and tasks.

Firstly, the 'Scoring request' is received by the 'Scoring request' task (sid-C2903B39-9435-4906-B3DB-81E577BEEA8B). This task then sends a 'Report delay to Bank' message to the 'Report delay to Bank' gateway (sid-CE9BCA89-3519-486D-A3F8-C691BBA12FF0).

Upon receiving the 'Delay input\nobtained' message from the 'Delay input\nobtained' gateway (sid-D5A08AF2-4C44-46CA-83C6-A9EE60D86043), the 'perform scoring level 2' task (sid-D6C6346E-1E93-42D6-A3F8-C691BBA12FF0) is triggered. This task processes the delay and sends a 'Scoring result transmitted' message to the 'Scoring result transmitted' gateway (sid-3D19DF8B-60DB-4EE3-9B01-FCA8BC9F650E).

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' task also sends a 'Scoring result transmitted' message to the 'Scoring result transmitted' gateway (sid-32015696-6D4E-4FE3-A4FB-22D4EEF1A977).

The 'Scoring result transmitted' messages from both gateways are then received by the 'Scoring result\ntransmitted' task (sid-FECB65C0-A5D4-4EBC-
