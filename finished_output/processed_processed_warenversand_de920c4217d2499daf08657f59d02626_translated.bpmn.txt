 The process begins with the 'Shipment' start event, where a shipment is initiated without any incoming tasks. The first task is to 'Pick up offers from three different freight forwarders', which requires incoming information about 'Large quantities?'. This task connects to 'Large quantities?' gateways, which in turn connect to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The next task is to 'Select a quote', which also requires incoming information about 'Large quantities?' and connects to 'Select a quote' gateways, which then connect to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Once the quotes are selected, the process moves to 'commission corresponding freight forwarders', which requires incoming information about 'Large quantities?' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. After commissioning the freight forwarders, the process proceeds to 'Filling standard package voucher', which requires incoming information about 'Large quantities?' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Following the voucher filling, 'Complete insurance' is performed, which requires incoming information about 'Insurance required?' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. After completing the insurance, the process moves to 'Packaging goods', which requires incoming information from 'ParallelGateway4' and connects to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Finally, the process concludes with 'Provide packaged goods for collection', which requires incoming information from 'ParallelGateway5' and connects to 'EndEvent0'. This marks the end of the process.
