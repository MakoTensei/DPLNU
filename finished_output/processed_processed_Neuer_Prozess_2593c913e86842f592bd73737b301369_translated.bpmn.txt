Once the shipping costs are obtained, the process moves to the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. This gateway has two incoming paths: one from ParallelGateway5 and another from the start event 'Shipping costs\nobtained'.

The 'Specialist' gateway has two incoming paths: one from 'Type of shipping?' and another from 'Insurance?'. It has one outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway has two incoming paths: one from 'decide on insurance' and another from 'Type of shipping?'. It has two outgoing paths: one to 'Goods collected' and another to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Goods collected' gateway has one incoming path from 'Insurance?' and one from 'ExclusiveGateway2'. It has no outgoing paths.
