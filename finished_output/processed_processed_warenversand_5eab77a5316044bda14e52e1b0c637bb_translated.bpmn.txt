 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the following sequence of tasks:

1. 'Provide goods for collection' is initiated, where the goods are prepared for shipment.

2. 'ParallelGateway7' is engaged to determine the shipping service provider.

3. 'Select the Spediteur' is activated, which leads to the selection of a shipping service provider.

4. The selected shipping service provider, 'Specialist', is engaged.

5. 'ExclusiveGateway3' is activated, which is the final gateway for the goods to be delivered.

6. 'Goods delivered' is the final event, which signifies the successful delivery of the goods.

During this process, the 'Insurance required?' gateway is also triggered to determine if insurance is needed for the shipment. If insurance is required, it leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which further connects to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

In summary, the process starts with the shipment of goods, followed by the selection of a shipping service provider, and ends with the delivery of goods. The insurance requirement is also checked during this process.
