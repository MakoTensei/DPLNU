 In a business process flow, a VN (Vietnamese) case is first checked for regression, which triggers the task 'Check the case' with the incoming event 'A VN can Regression taken'. If there is a possibility of regression, the task 'Set to WV' is initiated, leading to the 'WV expired' event. This event then triggers the 'Book the entrance' task.

The 'EndEvent0' task has two incoming events: 'EventBasedGateway2' and 'WV expired'. The 'EventBasedGateway2' leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which in turn can either lead to 'Enter the case' or 'WV expired' based on the incoming event. The 'WV expired' event leads to 'Book the entrance' or 'Enter the case' tasks.


The 'Enter the case' task has two outgoing events: 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' task has no outgoing events.
