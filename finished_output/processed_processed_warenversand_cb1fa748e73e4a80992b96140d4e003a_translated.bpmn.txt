 The process begins with the "Goods Shipping" event, which triggers the creation of a quote through ParallelGateway4, leading to a "Create a Quote" task. This quote is then forwarded to ParallelGateway7, where it eventually results in the "Goods Shipped" event.

Simultaneously, the "Goods Shipping" event also initiates the insurance process for the goods through Goods\ninsure?. This task is directed to ExclusiveGateway2, which in turn sends the goods to ParallelGateway7 and Goods shipped.

Additionally, the "Goods Shipping" event triggers the packaging process through ParallelGateway5, which sends the goods to ParallelGateway6 and ParallelGateway8. The packaged goods are then shipped, resulting in the "Goods Shipped" event.

Furthermore, the "Goods Shipping" event also leads to the posting of goods through Posting goods, which is routed to ParallelGateway7.

Lastly, the "Goods Shipped" event can occur through various paths, such as directly from ParallelGateway4, InclusiveGateway3, or ParallelGateway7, each leading to the final "Goods Shipped" event.
