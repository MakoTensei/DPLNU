 When a scoring request is obtained, the process begins at the EventBasedGateway3, which forwards the request to ExclusiveGateway0. ExclusiveGateway0 then sends a forward scoring result to the Scoring result (level 1) obtained task. If there is a result, the process continues to the Is there a result? task at Is there a result? gateway, which sends a Request Finished message to ExclusiveGateway2. ExclusiveGateway2 then sends a Request Finished message back to the original request source.

Alternatively, if there is no result, the process moves to the Report delay task at Report delay gateway, which sends a Level 2 Scoring message to the Level 2 Scoring task. The Level 2 Scoring task then sends a Send a reply message to ExclusiveGateway2, which in turn sends a Request Finished message back to the original request source.

In summary, the flow of the process is as follows:

1. Scoring request obtained at EventBasedGateway3
2. Forwarded to ExclusiveGateway0
3. ExclusiveGateway0 sends forward scoring result to Scoring result (level 1) obtained
4. If there is a result, proceed to Is there a result? gateway
5. Is there a result? sends Request Finished message to ExclusiveGateway2
6. ExclusiveGateway2 sends Request Finished message back to the original request source
7. If there is no result, proceed to Report delay gateway
8. Report delay sends Level 2 Scoring message to Level 2 Scoring
9. Level 2 Scoring sends Send a reply message to ExclusiveGateway2
10. ExclusiveGateway2 sends Request Finished message back to the original request source

This process ensures that the scoring request is handled efficiently and that the appropriate results are communicated back to the request source.
