 Upon receiving shipping costs, the process begins with checking the quantity of goods, which is facilitated by ParallelGateway4. This leads to a decision point where the user is presented with Lot? options. Choosing Lot? directs the flow to ExclusiveGateway3, which in turn connects to ParallelGateway5. Concurrently, the process also involves filling the package note, which requires obtaining shipping costs and is handled by ParallelGateway4, leading to Filling the package note.


Once the package is filled, the user is prompted to select an offer from the 3 available options, which is facilitated by ParallelGateway5. The selected offer leads to a specialist, ExclusiveGateway3, who then completes the insurance requirements. This is a critical step as it ensures that the goods are insured, and the process requires the user to confirm if insurance is necessary.


After insurance is confirmed, the goods are packaged, and the process proceeds to ParallelGateway5, where the user is presented with the Shipping order option. The Shipping order is the final step in the process, marking the completion of the task.


In summary, the process starts with obtaining shipping costs, followed by a series of decisions and actions involving checking quantities, filling the package note, selecting an offer, completing insurance requirements, and finally, shipping the order.
