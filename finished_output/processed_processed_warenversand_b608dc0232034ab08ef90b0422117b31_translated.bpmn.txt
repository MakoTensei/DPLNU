 In the logistics process, a series of tasks are carried out to ensure the smooth handling of goods. The journey begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to process the incoming goods. This gateway is responsible for 'Filling the package note' and 'Providing goods for collection'.

Once the goods are received, the 'Special shipment?' event is triggered, leading to the 'ParallelGateway3'. This gateway connects to 'Filling the package note' and 'ParallelGateway5', ensuring that the package is properly filled and sent to the next stage.

The 'Special offer' event then takes place, which connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway is responsible for 'Pick up offers' and 'Special offer', allowing the company to offer special deals to customers.

As the goods move forward, the 'ParallelGateway3' is triggered again, this time connecting to 'Packaging goods' and 'Provide goods for collection'. This ensures that the goods are packaged and ready for collection.

The 'Insurance required?' event is then triggered, leading to the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' is responsible for 'Fat' and 'ParallelGateway6', ensuring that the goods are insured and sent to the final collection point.

Finally, the 'Special offer' event is triggered once more, connecting to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway is responsible for 'Choose your offer', allowing customers to select their preferred offerings.

In summary, the logistics process involves a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, ensuring that goods are properly filled, packaged, insured, and delivered to customers.
