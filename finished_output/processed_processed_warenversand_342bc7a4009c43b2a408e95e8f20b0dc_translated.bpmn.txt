 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Special shipment required?' task. If the special shipment is required, the task proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, which finally concludes with the 'EndEvent0'. If the special shipment is not required, the process moves directly to the 'Filling the package note' task, which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then leads to the 'ParallelGateway5', and the process concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.
