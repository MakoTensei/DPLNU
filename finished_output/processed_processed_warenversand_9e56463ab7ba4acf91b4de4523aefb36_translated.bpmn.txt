 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task is connected to the 'Is special shipment necessary?' gateway, which in turn leads to the '3 offers' and 'Packaging goods' tasks.

Next, the 'Is insurance necessary?' event initiates the 'Complete insurance' task. This task is linked to the 'Is insurance necessary?' gateway, which connects to the 'Goods delivered' task.

The 'Choose the cheapest offer' task is triggered by the'sid-F3CF9845-8AFF-4B2F-9C83-B78E3AF15545' event and leads to the 'Specialist' task. This task is connected to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' gateway, which then connects to the 'Goods delivered' task.

Lastly, the 'Packaging goods' task is triggered by the'sid-2F7E8D0F-B2E3-4892-9E37-37D3D29DB9A2' event and leads to the '3 offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway, which in turn connects to the 'Filling the package note' task.

1. 'Goods are to be shipped' -> 'Filling the package note' -> 'Is special shipment necessary?' -> '3 offers' -> 'Packaging goods'
