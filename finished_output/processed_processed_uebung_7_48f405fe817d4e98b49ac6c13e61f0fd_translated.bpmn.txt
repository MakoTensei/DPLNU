 In the world of our system, various tasks and gateways work together to process and forward requests and results. Let's dive into the details:

1. When a 'Scoring request' event occurs, it triggers the 'EventBasedGateway2' to process the request. This gateway then forwards the request to the 'Get delay message' gateway, which sends a 'Get delay message' event to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

2. Upon receiving an 'Inquiry received' event, the system forwards a 'forward delay message to bank' task to the 'forward delay message to bank' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Get delay message' event to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

3. The 'Get Level Scoring 1' task is initiated when the 'Get Level Scoring 1' event is received. This task forwards the request to the 'Get delay message' gateway, which sends a 'Get delay message' event to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

4. The 'perform first scoring' task is triggered by the 'Inquiry received' event. It sends a request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, which then forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

5. The 'perform scoring 2' task is initiated when the 'Delay?' event is received. It sends a request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, which then forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

6. The 'Transfer results to Bank' task is triggered by the 'Request edited' event. It sends a request to the 'forward request' gateway, which forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

7. The 'forward request' task is initiated when the 'Scoring request' event is received. It sends a 'Get delay message' request to the 'Get delay message' gateway, which forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway2'.

8. The 'forward delay message to Frontend' task is triggered by the 'Get delay message' event. It sends a 'Request edited' request to the 'Request edited' gateway, which forwards the request to the '
