 A guest experiences hunger, prompting them to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they select a court, triggering the process to order their meal. The guest then places their order, which is recorded and sent to the kitchen. While waiting, the guest is informed about the payment process.

As the meal is prepared, the kitchen staff, referred to as Pieper, reports the progress to the front desk. The guest is then informed that the meal is ready and instructed to fetch it from the kitchen.

The front desk staff, upon receiving the cash payment, ends the transaction and prepares the meal for the guest. The guest fetches the meal from the kitchen, and the process concludes with the guest enjoying their meal.
