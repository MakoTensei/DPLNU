 In the process flow, a Regression check initiates the sequence, leading to the creation of a Book money receipt. If the Regression check is successful, the process proceeds to the ExclusiveGateway0, which can result in either a No regression or a 4 weeks waiting period. If the latter, the process moves to the 4 weeks waiting gateway, which then connects to the Debt collection office, closing the process. Conversely, if the Regression check fails, the process reaches the ExclusiveGateway1, which leads to the Debt collection office, closing the process. Additionally, the Regression check can also lead to the EventBasedGateway2, which can result in a 4 weeks waiting period, Money received, or the Debt collection office, closing the process. The VN event triggers the Dispense process to the debt collection office, and the Proceedings event closes the process. Finally, the No regression and Closed events mark the end of the process.
