 In the process of handling a Schufa request, the workflow begins with the 'Schufascoring\nenroll' event, which triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' process, initiated by the 'Schufa request\nEdit' event. This first level of scoring is carried out by the 'Level 2 scoring perform' task, which receives the'sid-B23B01CF-C912-4E9E-8B67-389B705B8EF6' trigger. Upon completion, the 'Scoring results\nsent' event is triggered, and the 'Result\nsend' gateway is activated, sending the results to the user.

Simultaneously, the 'Triggering the Schufa request' event also leads to the 'Scoring results\narrived' event, which in turn activates the 'Scoring results\nsent' gateway, ensuring that the results are communicated to the user. Additionally, the 'Scoring results\ndelayed' event is triggered, which sends the results to the'sid-1A779BAD-6EC8-48FF-945A-6CB50935F2B2' gateway.

The 'You okay?' gateway is also activated in response to the 'Schufa request\nEdit' event, sending the results to the'sid-29E1728E-E856-40ED-901B-EA02C5DF5D4D' gateway. Finally, the 'Wait for the\nScoring response' event is triggered, which sends the results to the 'Scoring results\nsent' gateway, completing the process.
