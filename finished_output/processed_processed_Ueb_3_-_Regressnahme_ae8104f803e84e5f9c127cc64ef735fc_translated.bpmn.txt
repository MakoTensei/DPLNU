1. The process starts with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which has no incoming connections. This event triggers the 'Request payment' task, which has 'Regression possibility\nReport' as its incoming connection.

2. The 'Request payment' task then leads to the 'Payment\nReport' task, which has 'Set to WV' as its incoming connection.
