 In the world of service orchestration, a series of events unfold to process a request for Schufaservice. The journey begins with a 'Schufascoring\nRequest\nReport' event, which triggers a 'Share delay\n' event, as it's determined that the scoring needs to be shared with ExclusiveGateway2.

Simultaneously, another 'Schufascoring\nRequest\nReport' event is processed, but this time it's directed to ExclusiveGateway2, which then sends a 'Transfer scoring' event to complete the request.

Meanwhile, the 'Share delay\n' event is also sent to ExclusiveGateway2, which in turn, sends a 'Share delay' event to EventBasedGateway3.

As the scoring process continues, a 'Schufascoring determined?\n' event is triggered, which sends a 'Request completed' event to ExclusiveGateway0 and a 'Share delay' event to EventBasedGateway3.

In the end, two 'Request completed' events are generated, one from EventBasedGateway3 and the other from Schufascoring determined?\n. These events mark the successful completion of the service request.
