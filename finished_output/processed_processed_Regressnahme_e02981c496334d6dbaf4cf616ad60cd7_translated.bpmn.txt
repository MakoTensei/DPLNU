 Upon regulating the damage, the system initiates an examination process, which is directed towards ExclusiveGateway1. If the damage is justified, the process transitions to ExclusiveGateway3, leading to a close event. Concurrently, if the damage has been regulated, a payment request is triggered, which upon obtaining a payment entry, proceeds to EndEvent0. Additionally, if the damage has been regulated, the process can also lead to an inkasso-dl handover event.


In the case of an opposition being obtained, the process diverts to ExclusiveGateway1, which can further lead to either a close event or an EndEvent1, depending on whether the opposition is justified. If the opposition is justified, the process moves to EndEvent1.


The system also has a deadline for opposition wait event, which can lead to EndEvent1.


The process begins with the damage regulation event, which connects to ExclusiveGateway3. This gateway can either lead to the close event or the EndEvent1, depending on the outcome of the opposition. If the opposition is justified, the process ends with EndEvent1. If the opposition is not justified, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway1, which can lead to either a close event or an EndEvent0, depending on the payment entry status.
