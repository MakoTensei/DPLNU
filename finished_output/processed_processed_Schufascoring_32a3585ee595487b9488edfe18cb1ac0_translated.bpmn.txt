 In a workflow involving scoring and event processing, the following sequence of tasks and gateways is activated:

1. A 'Scoring required' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which forwards the event to 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'EndEvent0'.
2. 'EventBasedGateway3' receives the 'Scoring required' event and sends it to 'Scoring Level 1' and 'Get delay message'.
3. 'Scoring Level 1' processes the 'Scoring request' and sends the results to 'forward scoring results'.
4. 'Get delay message' sends the 'Scoring required' event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Scoring required' event and forwards it to 'Scoring Level 2'.
6. 'Scoring Level 2' processes the 'Scoring required' event and sends the results to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
7. 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the results from 'Scoring Level 2' and sends them to 'EndEvent1'.
8. 'Result fixed' event is generated by 'Scoring Level 1' and is sent to 'EndEvent1' and 'Report delay'.
9. 'EndEvent1' is the final event in the workflow, signifying the completion of the scoring process.

This sequence ensures that scoring requests are processed efficiently, with appropriate handling of delays and event routing.
