 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. First, the 'Shipping clarification' task is initiated, which sends a request to 'ParallelGateway4'. This request is then followed by the 'Filling standard package voucher' task, also utilizing 'ParallelGateway4'.

Simultaneously, the 'Selection' task is triggered, which requires the 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Ordering Spediteur' task follows, which also uses 'ParallelGateway6' and leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Request a quote' task is initiated twice, both using 'ParallelGateway4' and leading to 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Packaging goods' task is also initiated using 'ParallelGateway4', leading to 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'Insurance close' task is triggered, which uses 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Special shipment necessary' gateway is triggered, which uses 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ParallelGateway7'. The 'Insurance necessary' gateway is also triggered, which uses 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway is used by both 'Ordering Spediteur' and 'ParallelGateway7'. The 'ParallelGateway7' gateway is used by both 'Special shipment necessary' and 'Insurance close'.

Finally, the process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', which has no outgoing connections and receives the'sid-977BD6D7-E6BC-4379-A98B-25931FE15D20' as its incoming connection.
