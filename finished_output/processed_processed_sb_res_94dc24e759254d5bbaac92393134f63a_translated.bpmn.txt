 The Court of Justice (Order) is triggered when a person feels hungry. Once the hunger is acknowledged, the system initiates the process to obtain an order for food. The buzzer is then activated to signal the need for food.

Upon obtaining the order, the system proceeds to prepare the food. The preparation order is granted, and the food is prepared.

The buzzer is activated again to indicate that the food is ready for collection. The person can now retrieve the food, which is marked as "Retrieved" in the system.

The completion status is checked to see if the waiting period has exceeded. If it has, the food is marked as ready for collection, and the buzzer is triggered again.

The person can now eat the food, and the system marks the event as "Eat food."

After eating, the person's hunger is no longer felt, and the buzzer is deactivated. The completion status is checked, and if the questions are answered, the process ends with the "EndEvent0."

If the person's hunger persists, the process repeats, triggering the Court of Justice (Order) again.

The system also includes gateways for different stages of the process, such as EventBasedGateway0 for handling hunger and food readiness, EventBasedGateway1 for handling orders and end events, and EventBasedGateway2 for handling food preparation and retrieval.

The start events include "Hunger\nfelt," "Order\nobtained," and "Preparation order\nobtained," while the end events include "EndEvent0," "EndEvent1," and "EndEvent2."
