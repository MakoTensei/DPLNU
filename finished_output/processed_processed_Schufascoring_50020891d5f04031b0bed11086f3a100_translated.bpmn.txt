 In the scoring process, the system starts with the 'Start scoring' event, which triggers the 'StartEvent1' and subsequently leads to the 'Delay?' gateway. This gateway then directs the flow to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which receives inputs from both 'Scoring\nLevel 1' and 'Scoring\nLevel 2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' subsequently sends the flow to 'EndEvent1', which concludes the scoring process. Meanwhile, 'Scoring\nLevel 2' also sends its input to 'EndEvent1', indicating the completion of the second level of scoring. The 'EventBasedGateway2' is another gateway that receives inputs from 'Scoring' and 'Waiting statement', and directs the flow to either 'Stop scoring' or 'Waiting statement' based on the conditions. The 'Waiting statement' then sends its output to'sid-57E9A4A6-87AE-411E-9F9B-106C710B15DE'.
