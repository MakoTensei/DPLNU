 When a shipment event occurs, it triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to process the incoming shipment. This gateway then routes the shipment to 'Select and order offer' and 'Insurance necessary?' tasks. The 'Select and order offer' task uses the shipment information to select and order a suitable transportation offer, while the 'Insurance necessary?' task determines if insurance is required for the shipment. Both tasks then send their outcomes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn routes the shipment to 'ParallelGateway4'.

Once the shipment reaches 'ParallelGateway4', it triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which prepares the goods for transport. After packaging, the shipment is ready to be delivered, and the 'Delivering goods' task is triggered. This task sends the ready goods to the final destination, completing the process.
