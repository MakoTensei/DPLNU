 The process begins with a 'Sufa\nRequest' event, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between different gateways and services. The 'Sufa\nRequest' initiates the scoring process, leading to the 'Scoring request' task. This task sends a 'Scoring result L1' to 'Send Scoring Result' and a 'Scoring result L2' to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The 'Scoring result L1' is then sent to 'EventBasedGateway3', which in turn sends a 'Scoring result L2' to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Scoring result L2' is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which completes the scoring process and sends a 'Scoring\ncompleted' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring result L2' is also sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which completes the process by sending a 'Schufa request\ncompleted' event.

In summary, the 'Sufa\nRequest' event initiates the scoring process, which involves multiple tasks and interactions between different gateways and services, ultimately leading to the completion of the scoring process and the sending of the 'Schufa request\ncompleted' event.
