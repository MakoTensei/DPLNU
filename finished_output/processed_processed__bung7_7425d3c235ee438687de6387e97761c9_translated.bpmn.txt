 When a "Schufascoring request" event occurs, it triggers a series of interactions between various gateways and services to process the request and determine the appropriate scoring level. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. The "Schufascoring request" event is initiated, and it sends a message to the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway.
2. The "EventBasedGateway1" gateway receives the "Schufascoring request" and forwards it to the "Scoring level 1" service.
3. The "Scoring level 1" service processes the request and sends a message back to the "EventBasedGateway1" gateway, indicating that the request has been handled and the scoring level is 1.

7. The "Scoring level 2" service processes the request and sends a "Scoring Level 2" message back to the "Scoring request" event.
8. If the "Schufascoring request" event is received by the "Conspiracy?" gateway, it sends a "Scoring Level 2" message to the "Scoring request" event.

10. The "Scoring level 2" service processes the request and sends a "Scoring Level 2" message back to the "Scoring request" event.
11. If the "Schufascoring request" event is received by the "Conspiracy?" gateway, it sends a "Scoring
