 When goods are ready to be shipped, the process begins with checking the order quantity through the 'Check order quantity' task, which involves the 'ParallelGateway2'. Once the quantity is confirmed, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated, utilizing 'ParallelGateway2' as well. Concurrently, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which requires the 'Quantity' information to be passed through the 'Insurance?' gateway. This task ensures that the goods are fully insured before they are shipped.


As the goods are packaged, the 'ParallelGateway3' is used to facilitate the 'Special delivery' process, which is essential for ensieving the goods are delivered promptly. The 'ParallelGateway3' also connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which is responsible for handling the 'Offer 2' and 'Offer 1' tasks. These offers are made available to the customer, providing them with additional options for their shipment.


Simultaneously, the 'Request offer 3' task is processed, which also utilizes 'ParallelGateway3' to present the customer with a new offer. The 'ParallelGateway4' continues to manage the flow of goods, ensuring that the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway4' are in sync.


Once the goods are fully packaged and insured, the 'Filling the package note' task is executed, which involves documenting the details of the shipment, including the quantity, and whether insurance is included. This task is linked to 'ParallelGateway4', which also handles the 'Offer 2' and 'Offer 1' tasks.


Finally, the goods are ready for collection, and the 'Goods are ready for collection' event is triggered, marking the end of the shipping process. Throughout this entire process, the 'ParallelGateway4' plays a crucial role in managing the flow of goods and offers, ensuring a smooth and efficient shipping experience for the customer.
