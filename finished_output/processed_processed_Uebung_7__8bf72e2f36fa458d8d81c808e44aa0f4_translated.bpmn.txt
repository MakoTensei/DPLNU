 In the process of scoring requests, the system follows a sequence of events and interactions between various gateways and services. Here's a natural flow description of the described system:

1. A 'Schufascoring request' is obtained, triggering the start event.
2. The system sends a 'Schufascoring query' to obtain the necessary information.
3. The 'Schufaservice' provides feedback, which is then used to determine if the scoring is successful.
4. If the scoring is successful, the system sends a 'Scoring result' report.
5. If the scoring is not successful, the system sends a 'Delay message' to forward the request.
6. The 'Delay message' is received, and the system sends a 'Scoring query' to re-evaluate the request.
7. The 'Schufaservice' provides feedback again, and the system determines if the scoring is successful.
8. If the scoring is successful, the system sends a 'Report scoring result' to summarize the outcome.
9. If the scoring is not successful, the system sends a 'Report delay message' to indicate the need for re-evaluation.
10. The 'Report delay message' is received, and the system implements a second scoring attempt.
11. The second scoring attempt is completed, and the system sends a 'Report scoring result 2' to summarize the outcome.
12. The system sends a 'Scoring query' to confirm the completion of the second scoring attempt.
13. The 'Scoring query' is completed, and the process ends.

The system's flow is managed by various gateways and services, such as 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'Feedback from Schufaservice', and 'Scoring 1 successful?' gateways, which help in routing and processing the requests and feedback.
