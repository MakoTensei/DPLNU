 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to handle the incoming task. This gateway then forwards the task to 'ParallelGateway4', which is responsible for packaging the goods. Once the packaging is complete, the task is sent to 'ParallelGateway5' for filling the standard package. After the package is filled, the task is forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway1' for choosing the most convenient forwarding. The task is then sent to 'ParallelGateway5' for packet insurance. Finally, the task reaches the 'Output' event, which signifies the completion of the process.
