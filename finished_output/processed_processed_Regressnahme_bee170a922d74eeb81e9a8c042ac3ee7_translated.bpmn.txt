 When a regression report is received, the system checks if a regression is possible, which triggers the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway. If the gateway determines that a regression is possible, it sends a payment request to the 'Send payment request' task. This task then sets up a process for resubmission, which leads to the 'Reimbursement period\nExpired' task. The 'Reimbursement period\nExpired' task initiates a debt collection process, resulting in the 'Debt collection\nThis\nPowered' task. Concurrently, the 'Reasons\nReport' task is triggered by the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway and also contributes to the debt collection process. Once the debt collection process is complete, the system closes the relevant tasks and events, marking the end of the process.
