 In the logistics process, there are several tasks and gateways involved in handling shipping goods. The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' start event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle incoming tasks. From there, the 'Separation of transport companies' task is initiated, which requires the 'ParallelGateway3' to process incoming tasks and eventually leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

Simultaneously, the 'Pick up offers from three freight forwarders' task is also initiated, which requires the 'ParallelGateway4' to process incoming tasks and eventually leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'. Additionally, the 'Insurance check if necessary' task is triggered, which also requires the 'ParallelGateway5' to process incoming tasks.

Once all tasks are completed, the 'EndEvent0' event is triggered, which requires the 'ParallelGateway5' to process incoming tasks and marks the end of the process.

In summary, the logistics process involves the following tasks and gateways:

1. 'Shipping goods' start event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
2. 'Separation of transport companies' task requires 'ParallelGateway3'.
3. 'Pick up offers from three freight forwarders' task requires 'ParallelGateway4'.
4. 'Insurance check if necessary' task requires 'ParallelGateway5'.
5. 'EndEvent0' event requires 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' serves as a central hub for all incoming and outgoing tasks, ensuring that the logistics process runs smoothly and efficiently.
