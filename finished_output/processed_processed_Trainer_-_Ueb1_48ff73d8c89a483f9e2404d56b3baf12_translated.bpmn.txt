 The process begins with the 'Goods\nShip' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task. This task receives incoming data from 'ParallelGateway4'. The task then sends an outgoing message to 'Select a quote', which is also triggered by 'Special shipment?' coming in from 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Select a quote' task sends an outgoing message to 'Specialist', which is triggered by 'Special shipment?' coming in from 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Specialist' task sends an outgoing message to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is triggered by 'Special shipment?' coming in from 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task sends an outgoing message to 'Complete insurance', which is triggered by 'Insurance necessary' coming in from 'Special shipment?'. The 'Complete insurance' task sends an outgoing message to 'ParallelGateway5', which is triggered by 'Insurance necessary' coming in from 'Special shipment?'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task sends an outgoing message to 'Shipment\nprepared', which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Insurance necessary' coming in from 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Special shipment?' respectively.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods\nShip' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Shipment\nprepared' event. The tasks and gateways involved in this process are 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers', 'Select a quote', 'Specialist', 'ExclusiveGateway3', 'Complete insurance', and 'ParallelGateway5'.
