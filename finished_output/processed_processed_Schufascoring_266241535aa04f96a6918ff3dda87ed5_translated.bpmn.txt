 In the scoring process, a request initiates with the 'Start of the request' event, which triggers the 'Send delay message' task. This task is then followed by the 'Entrance of the request' event, leading to the 'Report delay of the bank' task. The 'Report delay of the bank' task sends a message to the 'Level 2 Scoring result' gateway, which in turn sends the result to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends the final result of the scoring process.

The 'Level 1 Scoring result' task, triggered by the 'Entrance of the request' event, sends the result to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends the final result of the scoring process.

In summary, the scoring process starts with the 'Start of the request' event, followed by a series of tasks and gateways that handle the scoring request, delay messages, and final results. The process concludes with the 'Final of the request' event, where the final result is delivered.
