 When a scoring request is initiated, it triggers the StartEvent1, which then leads to the Scoring Level 1 process. This process is completed with EndEvent3, and the IntermediateCatchEvent2 is generated as a result. The IntermediateCatchEvent2, in turn, triggers EndEvent1.

After EndEvent1, the scoring request is forwarded to the EventBasedGateway1, which then sends the request to Scoring Level 2. The Scoring Level 2 process is completed with EndEvent5, and the IntermediateCatchEvent5 is generated as a result.

The IntermediateCatchEvent5 triggers EndEvent0, which is the final step in the process.

In summary, the flow of the process is as follows:

1. A scoring request is initiated, triggering StartEvent1.
2. StartEvent1 leads to Scoring Level 1, which is completed with EndEvent3 and generates IntermediateCatchEvent2.
3. IntermediateCatchEvent2 triggers EndEvent1.
4. EndEvent1 sends the request to EventBasedGateway1, which then sends the request to Scoring Level 2.
5. Scoring Level 2 is completed with EndEvent5 and generates IntermediateCatchEvent5.
6. IntermediateCatchEvent5 triggers EndEvent0, marking the end of the process.
