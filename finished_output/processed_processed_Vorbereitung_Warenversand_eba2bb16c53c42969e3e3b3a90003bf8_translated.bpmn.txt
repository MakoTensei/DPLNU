 In the logistics process, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up offer' and 'Delivering goods' tasks. The 'Pick up offer' task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and subsequently leads to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Delivering goods' task is directly linked to the 'ParallelGateway3' and eventually ends at 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Claws quantity' task, which is initiated by 'StartEvent0', is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4' and leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Standard Packing Card' task, also initiated by 'StartEvent0', is connected to the 'ParallelGateway6'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' is also connected to the 'Insurance close' task, which is initiated by 'ParallelGateway4' and leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' is connected to the 'EndEvent0' and is also linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' is connected to the 'EndEvent0' and the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway3' is connected to the 'Delivering goods' task and the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' is connected to the 'ParallelGateway3' and the 'ParallelGateway6'.
