 When a scoring request is initiated, it first passes through ExclusiveGateway0, which then sends the request to Share delay and ExclusiveGateway1. At ExclusiveGateway1, the request is further processed and eventually leads to the First scoring (level 1) task, which generates an IntermediateCatchEvent3. This event then triggers the Deep scoring (level 2) task at ExclusiveGateway2, resulting in the creation of two Scoring\nInfo events. The first Scoring\nInfo event is sent to IntermediateCatchEvent3, while the second and third Scoring\nInfo events are sent to ExclusiveGateway2.
