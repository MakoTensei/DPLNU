 Upon receiving a request, the process begins with the 'Request arrived' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to handle the special shipment. From there, the 'Special shipment?' gateway receives the request and directs it to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. 'ExclusiveGateway1' then routes the request to 'ParallelGateway5' for further processing.

Next, the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway receives the request and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ParallelGateway5'. 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the request to 'ParallelGateway5', which then directs the request to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Once the offer of 3 carriers is picked up, 'ParallelGateway5' receives the offer and sends it to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the offer to 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Request arrived' event, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' handling the special shipment. The 'Special shipment?' gateway routes the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the request to 'ParallelGateway5', which then directs the request to 'ParallelGateway5'. The offer of 3 carriers is picked up and sent to 'ParallelGateway5', which finally sends the offer to 'EndEvent0'.
