 In the world of logistics, a series of interconnected tasks and decisions are made to ensure the smooth delivery of goods. Let's dive into the flow of these processes:

1. When an order comes in, it triggers the 'Order comes from' event, which initiates the process by sending the order to 'ParallelGateway7'.

2. At 'ParallelGateway7', the system checks if insurance is necessary by consulting 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If insurance is required, the system proceeds to 'Complete insurance' task, which then sends a confirmation to 'ParallelGateway7'.

3. Concurrently, 'ParallelGateway7' also checks if a special shipment is needed by consulting 'Is special shipment necessary?'. If a special shipment is required, the system moves to the 'Specialist' task, which then sends a confirmation to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

4. If no special shipment is needed, the system proceeds to 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task, which sends a request to 'Select the best forwarder' task.

5. The 'Select the best forwarder' task consults 'Is special shipment necessary?' to determine if a special shipment is needed. If not, it sends a confirmation to 'ParallelGateway6'.

6. If a special shipment is needed, the 'Select the best forwarder' task consults 'Is special shipment necessary?' again and sends a confirmation to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

7. The 'ParallelGateway6' task then consults 'Is insurance necessary?' to determine if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, it sends a confirmation to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

8. The 'ParallelGateway7' task processes the order and sends a confirmation to 'Processed'.

9. Finally, the 'Processed' event signifies the completion of the order processing, and the system sends a confirmation to 'ParallelGateway5'.

This interconnected flow of tasks and decisions ensures that the logistics process is efficient and adaptable to the specific needs of each order.
