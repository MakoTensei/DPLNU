 In the financial services process, the workflow begins with the receipt of a 'Regression report\nReport'. This triggers the 'Regress possibility check' task, which then sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If the regression report indicates a possible default, the 'Debt collection office' task is initiated, which also sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Concurrently, the 'Book payment receipt' task is activated, sending a request to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

If the regression report does not indicate a possible default, the 'Send payment request' task is triggered, which sends a request to 'Incoming payment\nReport'. This report then leads to the 'Process\nFinished' task, which closes the process and sends a signal to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
