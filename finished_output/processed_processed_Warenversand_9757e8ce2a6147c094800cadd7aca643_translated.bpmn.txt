 Starting with the process of shipping goods, the journey begins at the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Choose your offer' task. This task is responsible for selecting the best offer for the shipping process.

Once the offer is chosen, the goods are then packaged, and the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7' and leads to the 'Shipping order completed' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping goods' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which is connected to the 'Type of shipping?' gateways. This task is responsible for filling the package note and leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is connected to both the 'Filling the package note' and 'Complete insurance' tasks. The 'Complete insurance' task is triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' event and is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is also connected to the 'ParallelGateway5' task, which is triggered by the 'Shipping goods' and 'ParallelGateway4' tasks. The 'ParallelGateway5' task leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is connected to the 'Type of shipping?' and 'Complete insurance' tasks. The 'Type of shipping?' task is triggered by the 'Filling the package note' task and is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is also connected to the 'ParallelGateway7' task, which is triggered by the 'Packaging goods' and 'Complete insurance' tasks.

Finally, the 'Shipping order completed' event is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway7' task, marking the end of the shipping process.
