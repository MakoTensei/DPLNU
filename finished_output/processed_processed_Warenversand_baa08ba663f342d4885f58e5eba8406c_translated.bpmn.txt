 The Secretariat initiates the shipping process by clearing incoming goods at ParallelGateway5, which then connects to ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway is responsible for collecting offers from the incoming goods.

Simultaneously, the Secretariat also fills out the necessary parcel notes for the incoming goods at ExclusiveGateway0. The filled parcel notes are then sent to ExclusiveGateway2.

The logistics manager locks the insurance for the shipment at ExclusiveGateway1, which is connected to ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway5 also creates a new shipping agent, Spediteur 1, and sends it to ParallelGateway4.

ParallelGateway3, another shipping agent, is created and receives offers from ParallelGateway5. It then sends these offers to ParallelGateway4.

ParallelGateway5 reviews the offers from the incoming goods and sends them to the Secretariat's freight forwarders at ParallelGateway4.

The goods are now ready for dispatch, and the process moves to ParallelGateway5, which connects to the Warehouse Processer at ParallelGateway6.

The Warehouse Processer, upon receiving the goods, processes them and sends them to the EndEvent0.

The Secretariat's freight forwarders, at ParallelGateway4, receive the offers from ParallelGateway5 and send them to ExclusiveGateway2.

Finally, ExclusiveGateway2 sends the processed goods to the EndEvent0.
