 In a flowing narrative, the process begins with the 'Schufa Information\nrequired' event, which triggers the Level 1 scoring process. This event sends a 'Schufascoring request\nwe have discussed' message to the 'Scorig results\nsend' gateway, initiating the scoring process.

Once the Level 1 scoring is complete, the 'Level 1 OK' event is generated, which then sends 'Schufa Information\nsent' messages to both the 'Scorig results\nsend' and 'Schufa Information\nsent' gateways.

Meanwhile, the 'Schufascoring request\nwe have discussed' event also triggers the 'Delay\nobtained' event, which in turn sends a 'Delay\nobtained' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then sends 'Schufadata\nsupplied' messages to both the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' and 'Scorig results\nsend' gateways.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' gateway receives the 'Schufata datad' message and sends 'Send results to Frontend\n' messages to the 'Frontend' gateway.

Finally, the 'Schufata datad' event triggers the 'Schufa Information\nsent' event, which sends 'Schufa Information\nsent' messages to both the 'Level 1 OK' and 'Schufa Information\nsent' gateways.

The process concludes with the 'Schufata datad' event sending 'Schufa Information\nsupplied' messages to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then completes the flow.
