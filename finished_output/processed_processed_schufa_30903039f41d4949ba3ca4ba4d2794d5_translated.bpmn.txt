 The process begins with the event 'Scoring request obtained', which triggers the following sequence of tasks:

1. The 'Send Scoring request to Schufa' task is initiated, sending the scoring request to Schufa.
2. Upon receiving the scoring request, the 'Delay message obtained' task is triggered.
3. The 'Delay message obtained' task then leads to the 'Report delay to sales staff' task, which communicates the delay to the sales staff.
4. The 'Delay message obtained' task also triggers the 'Transfer Scoring Results (Level 2) to Credit Transfer' task, which transfers the scoring results to the credit transfer system.
5. The 'Scoring results (level 1) on credit lending' task is initiated, which processes the scoring results obtained from Schufa.
6. The 'Scoring results (level 1) on credit lending' task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' task, which completes the scoring process.
7. The 'Scoring results (level 2) obtained' task is triggered, which processes the scoring results obtained from the credit transfer system.
8. The 'Scoring results (level 2) obtained' task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' task, which completes the scoring process.

The process ends with the 'Scoring completed' event, which signifies the completion of the scoring process.
