 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive manner:

1. When a customer feels hungry, they request to select a court.
2. The customer adds their order to the system.
3. The system receives the order report and sends it to the Exclusive Gateway 0.
4. The Exclusive Gateway 0 checks the order report and sends a 5-minute notification to the system.
5. If the Pieper (food preparation system) is active, the system informs the Exclusive Gateway 0.
6. The Exclusive Gateway 0 sends the 5-minute notification to the system again.
7. If the customer arrives at the issue, the system informs the Event-Based Gateway 1.
8. The Event-Based Gateway 1 processes the customer's arrival and sends a completion notification to the system.
9. The system checks if the Pieper is active and sends a notification to the customer that the food is ready.
10. The customer eats the meal, which distills their hunger.
11. The system sends a completion notification to the employees.
12. The system checks if the meal is finished and sends a 5-minute notification to the system.
13. If the customer arrives at the issue, the system informs the Event-Based Gateway 1.
14. The Event-Based Gateway 1 processes the customer's arrival and sends a completion notification to the system.
15. The system checks if the meal is finished and sends a completion notification to the employees.

This flow of events ensures that the customer's hunger is satisfied, and the food preparation and delivery process is efficient and timely.
