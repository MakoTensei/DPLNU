 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nProcess started' event, which triggers the 'Send scoring inquiry to Schufa' task. This task sends a message to the Schufa system and awaits a response. Once the Schufa system processes the inquiry, the 'Check the results' task is initiated, which in turn triggers the 'forward result to Frontend Bank' task. This task checks if there is a time delay in the results and, if so, consults with the relevant team.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event triggers the 'Report delay to Bank' task, which also consults with the team if there is a delay. The 'perform scoring level 1' task is then executed, which sends an exclusive gateway message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. This task determines the results and shares them with the team.

If there is a delay, the 'perform scoring level 2' task is executed, which consults with the team and determines the results. The 'Results determined' event triggers the 'Send notification to sales staff via delay' task, which notifies the sales staff about the delay.

In summary, the process involves sending scoring inquiries to Schufa, checking the results, consulting with the team if there is a delay, performing scoring levels, and sharing the results with the team. The process also includes sending notifications to the sales staff in case of delays.
