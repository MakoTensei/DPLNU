 1. Credit examination requested -> forward credit assessment
2. Credit examination requested -> Run other tasks
3. Scoring question obtained -> Transfer scoring level 1
4. Scoring question obtained -> Customer information
5. Credit evaluation obtained -> Credit assessment completed
6. Scoring order finished -> Information
7. Scoring order finished -> Customer information
8. Credit evaluation obtained -> Credit assessment completed
9. Transfer scoring level 1 -> Scoring order finished

In this flow, the tasks are processed in the following sequence:

1. Credit examination requested triggers two parallel paths:
   a. Forward credit assessment
   b. Run other tasks

2. Scoring question obtained initiates two parallel paths:
   a. Transfer scoring level 1
   b. Customer information

3. Credit evaluation obtained leads to Credit assessment completed.

4. Transfer scoring level 1 results in Scoring order finished.

5. Customer information is the final output from the parallel path of Scoring question obtained.

End events:

1. Credit assessment completed (from Credit evaluation obtained)
2. Scoring order finished (from Transfer scoring level 1)
3. Credit assessment completed (from Credit evaluation obtained)
4. Scoring order finished (from ParallelGateway1)
