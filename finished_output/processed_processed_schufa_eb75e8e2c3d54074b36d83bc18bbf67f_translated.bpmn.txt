 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'Scoring\nrequested' event. This request is then forwarded to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn sends the 'Scoring\nforwarded' event. The 'Scoring\nforwarded' event initiates the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which is performed and results in a 'Result?' event. This 'Result?' event is received by the 'Result?' gateway, which then sends a 'Result\nReported back' event. The 'Result\nReported back' event triggers the 'Level 2 scoring' task, which is completed and reported back with a 'Result\nReported back' event. The 'Result\nReported back' event is then sent to the 'Result?' gateway, completing the scoring process.
