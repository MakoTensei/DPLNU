 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the selection of an offer from the 'Select your offer' gateway. This is followed by the 'Prepare for delivery' task, which initiates the process of insurance verification and the preparation of goods for delivery.

Once the goods are ready for delivery, the '3 Acquisitions' task is triggered, which sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway6' for further processing. This gateway then forwards the goods to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' for insurance verification and the filling of the parcel certificate.

After the insurance and certificate are verified, the 'Insurance close' task is initiated, which sends a request to the 'ParallelGateway7' for insurance confirmation. Once the insurance is confirmed, the goods are sent to the 'ParallelGateway6' again for final processing.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' event is triggered, marking the completion of the process. The goods have successfully been shipped, insured, and prepared for delivery.
