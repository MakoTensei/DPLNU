 When a large amount of goods is sent, the process begins with a check to determine if insurance is necessary, followed by selecting a freight forwarder. The goods are then packaged, and the selected freight forwarder is engaged. The process involves a parallel gateway for the initial check and exclusive gateways for insurance and freight forwarder selection. Once the freight forwarder is chosen, the goods are sent, and the process concludes with the goods being dispatched.
