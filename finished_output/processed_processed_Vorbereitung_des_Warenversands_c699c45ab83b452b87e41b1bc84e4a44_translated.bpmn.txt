 The process begins with the event 'Goods to Ship', which triggers the 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Check whether insurance is executable' task. The 'Check whether insurance is executable' task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to the 'Insurance close' task.

Once the insurance is confirmed, the process moves to the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task leads to the 'Select an angeobed' task, which is linked to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Select an angeobed' task is connected to the 'Specialist' task, which then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' again.

The 'Specialist' task is followed by the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This task leads to the 'Packing goods' task, which is also connected to the 'ParallelGateway4'.

Finally, the 'Packing goods' task connects to the 'Goods for collection ready' task, which is the end event of the process. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', completing the entire process.
