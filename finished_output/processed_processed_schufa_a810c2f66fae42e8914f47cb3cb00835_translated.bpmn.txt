 When a scoring request is received, it triggers a series of events and interactions between various systems and gateways. The process begins with the 'Requests received' event, which sends the incoming request to EventBasedGateway3. Simultaneously, a 'Scoring request' event is initiated, directing the request to ExclusiveGateway1.

At ExclusiveGateway1, the request is determined, and the system sends a 'determined' event to EventBasedGateway2. EventBasedGateway2 then processes the determined request and sends a 'Score completed' event to the system.

Meanwhile, EventBasedGateway3, which received the 'Requests received' event, sends a 'Score completed' event to the system as well. This ensures that the scoring process is completed and the results are communicated to the system.

In summary, the flow of events and interactions for scoring requests is as follows:

1. 'Requests received' event sends the incoming request to EventBasedGateway3.
2. 'Scoring request' event sends the request to ExclusiveGateway1.
3. ExclusiveGateway1 determines the request and sends a 'determined' event to EventBasedGateway2.
4. EventBasedGateway2 processes the determined request and sends a 'Score completed' event to the system.
5. EventBasedGateway3 also sends a 'Score completed' event to the system, ensuring that the scoring process is completed and the results are communicated.
