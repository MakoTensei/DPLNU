 When goods are ready for dispatch, the process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the '3 offers' task. This task then leads to the 'Check quantity' task, which in turn initiates the 'Big crowd?' event. The 'Big crowd?' event connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which subsequently sends the 'Insurance necessary?' event. This event triggers the 'Insurance close' task, which sends the 'Good quality' event to the 'Insurance necessary?' task.

Simultaneously, the '3 offers' task also leads to the '3 offers' task, which triggers the 'Specialist' event. The 'Specialist' event connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which then sends the 'Packaging goods' event to the 'Specialist' task.

The 'Good quality' event, triggered by the 'Insurance close' task, connects to the 'Insurvey' task, which in turn sends the 'Good quality' event to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' task then concludes the process, resulting in the 'Good quality' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, leading to the '3 offers' task, which triggers the 'Check quantity' task. This task connects to the 'Big crowd?' event, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task triggers the 'Insurance necessary?' event, which leads to the 'Insurance close' task. The 'Insurance close' task connects to the 'Insurvey' task, which concludes the process with the 'Good quality' event.

Meanwhile, the '3 offers' task also triggers the 'Specialist' event, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' task leads to the 'Packaging goods' event, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' task. The 'ParallelGateway5' task concludes the process with the 'Good quality' event.
