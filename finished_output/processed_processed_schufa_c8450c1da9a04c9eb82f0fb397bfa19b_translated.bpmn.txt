 In a seamless workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'EventBasedGateway2', which then leads to the 'Schufa query\nStart' task. This task, upon completion, sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' gateway. Subsequently, the 'Leave a reply' task is initiated, which concludes with the 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Level 1' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', and the 'Share delay' task, also initiated by 'StartEvent1', both route to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then directs both tasks to the 'EndEvent1'. Concurrently, the 'Result there?' gateway receives the 'StartEvent1' and sends it to 'EndEvent1' and 'Share delay'. The 'Scoring Level 2' task, which is dependent on the 'Share delay', also passes through the 'ExclusiveGateway1' before reaching its conclusion.
