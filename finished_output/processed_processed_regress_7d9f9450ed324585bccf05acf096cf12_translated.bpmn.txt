 In a process flow, the 'VN can be taken into regress' task is initiated and directed towards ExclusiveGateway0, which then leads to the 'EndEvent0' task. Concurrently, the 'Set process for re-submission status' task, triggered by 'VN can be taken into regress', is routed to ExclusiveGateway2. This task also has a direct outcome of 'Money received', which in turn leads to the 'Book the entrance' task.

Meanwhile, the 'VN contradicts' task, originating from 'EventBasedGateway4', is directed towards ExclusiveGateway3. This task also triggers the 'Counterfeit has expired' task, which subsequently leads to the 'Transfer process to inkasso'.

In summary, the process flow can be described as follows:

1. 'VN can be taken into regress' task is initiated and directed towards ExclusiveGateway0.
2. 'Set process for re-submission status' task, triggered by 'VN can be taken into regress', is routed to ExclusiveGateway2.
3. 'Set process for re-submission status' task leads to 'Money received' task, which in turn leads to 'Book the entrance' task.
4. 'VN contradicts' task, originating from 'EventBasedGateway4', is directed towards ExclusiveGateway3.
5. 'Counterfeit has expired' task, triggered by 'VN contradicts', leads to 'Transfer process to inkasso'.

This process flow ensures that tasks are routed to the appropriate gateways and outcomes, maintaining a smooth and efficient process.
