 A guest experiences hunger and decides to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they are presented with three dish options to choose from. After making their selection, they proceed to the payment process. Once the payment is completed, the order is set, and the food is prepared. The guest arrives at the restaurant, and the food is served. They enjoy their meal and report back to the restaurant, indicating that the order is complete. The restaurant then prepares the food and serves it to the guest, who finishes their meal and reports back, completing the order.
