 The process begins with the dispatch of goods, which triggers the 'Select your offer' task through the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn initiates the 'Pick up offers from forwarders' task. Once the offer is selected, the process moves to 'ParallelGateway4', where the 'Goods Pickup made available' task is executed. This task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0', completing the process.

In parallel, the 'Clearing the route' task is initiated through 'ParallelGateway3', which connects to 'ParallelGateway2'. This task leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which then proceeds to 'ParallelGateway4'. Here, the 'Goods Pickup made available' task is triggered.

Meanwhile, the 'Goods dispatched they are' task initiates the 'Need to check insurance' task through 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task connects to 'ParallelGateway2', which leads to the 'Complete insurance' task. This task is then routed to 'ParallelGateway4', where the 'Goods Pickup made available' task is executed.

Lastly, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated through 'ParallelGateway3', which connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is linked to the 'Goods Pickup made available' task, completing the process.

In summary, the process involves the dispatch of goods, selection of offers, packaging, and pickup of goods, with various tasks and gateways interconnected to ensure a smooth flow of operations.
