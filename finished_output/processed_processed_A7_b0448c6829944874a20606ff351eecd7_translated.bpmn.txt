 The system processes incoming Schufa score requests and determines the score level. Once the score level is determined, it sends the result to the corresponding level determined gateway. For example, when a Schufa score request is received, the system determines the score level and sends the result to the 'Level 1 determined?' gateway. This gateway then forwards the result to the 'Level 1 determined?' end event, which sends the score to the appropriate recipient. Similarly, when a Schufa score request is received, the system determines the score level and sends the result to the 'Determine Level 2' gateway. This gateway then forwards the result to the 'Delay?' gateway, which in turn sends the result to the 'Level 2 determined?' end event, which sends the score to the appropriate recipient. The 'Delay?' gateway also handles intermediate events, such as 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which forwards the result to the 'Delay?' gateway. The system starts with the 'Schufa request\nReport' event, which triggers the process of determining the score level and sending the result to the appropriate end event.
