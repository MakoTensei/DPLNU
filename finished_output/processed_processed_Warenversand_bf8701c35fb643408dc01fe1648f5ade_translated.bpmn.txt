 The process begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'Prepare for special shipment / 3 Send inquiries' task. This task requires the 'Size of shipping?' inquiry, which is handled by the 'Size of shipping?' gateway. The gateway receives the 'Start' event and sends it to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'Prepare for special shipment / 3 Send inquiries'.
