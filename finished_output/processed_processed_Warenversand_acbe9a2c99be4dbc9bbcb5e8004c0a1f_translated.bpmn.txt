 The process begins with the event 'Shipping goods', which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to initiate the sequence. This leads to the 'Special shipment necessary?' gateway, which in turn sends a 'Send a message' to inquire about the need for insurance. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Insurance\nclose' gateway is activated, which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' to proceed with the process.

Parallelly, the 'Shipping goods' event also triggers 'ParallelGateway4', which sends a 'Special shipment necessary?' message to the same gateway. This message leads to the 'Send a message' gateway, which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which sends a 'Specialist' message to the 'Specialist' gateway. The 'Specialist' gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which finally leads to the'ready for dispatch' event.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:

1. 'Shipping goods' event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway3'
2. 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends a 'Send a message' to inquire about insurance
3. If insurance is necessary, 'Insurance\nclose' gateway is activated and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'
4. Simultaneously, 'Shipping goods' event also triggers 'ParallelGateway4'
5. 'ParallelGateway4' sends a 'Special shipment necessary?' message to 'Send a message' gateway
6. 'Send a message' gateway connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'
7. 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'ParallelGateway5'
8. 'ParallelGateway5' sends a 'Specialist' message to 'Specialist' gateway
9. 'Specialist' gateway connects to 'ParallelGateway5'
10. 'ParallelGateway5' leads to the'ready for dispatch' event.
