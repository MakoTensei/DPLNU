 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and conversational way:

1. The customer feels hungry, triggering the event "Hunger felt."
2. The customer decides to visit the restaurant and adds their order to the system.
3. The customer chooses their food, which is then processed by the system.
5. The kitchen prepares the food and informs the employees.
6. The restaurant staff informs the customer that their food is ready.
7. The customer reacts positively to the news and confirms the order.
8. The restaurant takes the order and prepares it for pickup.
9. The customer arrives at the restaurant and picks up their food.
10. The restaurant staff signals the Pieper (a delivery person) that the order is ready.
11. Pieper picks up the food and delivers it to the customer.
12. The customer experiences satisfaction (famine) after eating the food.
13. The order is completed, and the customer is informed that their order is ready.
14. The customer is informed that they have already placed the same order three times, and the order is completed.
15. The order is completed, and the employees are informed.

This flow of events captures the customer's journey from feeling hungry to enjoying their meal and completing the order.
