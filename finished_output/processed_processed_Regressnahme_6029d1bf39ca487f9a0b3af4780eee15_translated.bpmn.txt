 The process begins with the submission of a regression possibility, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure proper handling and decision-making.

1. The regression possibility is submitted, and the 'Destroying' task is triggered, as it is the first task in the workflow with an incoming link to 'Regression possibility submitted.'

2. The 'Destroying' task then connects to the 'Regression possibility given?' gateway, which has an incoming link to 'Regression possibility submitted.' The gateway decides to forward the process to 'Process Debt collection forwarded' and 'Process Unsuccessful closed' tasks.

3. The 'Process Debt collection forwarded' task is triggered, and it has an incoming link to 'Regression possibility given?' gateway. It connects to the 'Notification' gateway, which has an incoming link to 'Regression possibility given?'

4. The 'Process Debt collection forwarded' task also connects to the 'Process Successful completed' task, which has an incoming link to 'EventBasedGateway2.'

5. The 'Process Successful completed' task connects to the 'Reimbursement deadline expired' gateway, which has an incoming link to 'EventBasedGateway2.'

6. The 'Reimbursement deadline expired' gateway triggers the 'Debt collection forward DL' task, which has an incoming link to 'Reimbursement deadline expired.'

7. The 'justified?' gateway is triggered, with an incoming link to 'Regression possibility given?' and connects to the 'Process Successful completed' and 'Process Unsuccessful closed' tasks.

8. The 'Process Successful completed' task is triggered, with an incoming link to 'EventBasedGateway2,' and connects to the 'Notification' gateway.

9. The 'Process Unsuccessful closed' task is triggered, with an incoming link to 'Regression possibility given?'

The process concludes with the 'Process Unsuccessful closed' task, which has no outgoing links, and the 'Process Successful completed' task, which also has no outgoing links.
