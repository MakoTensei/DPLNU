 The process begins with the 'Goods stand for shipping' event, where the incoming is 'ParallelGateway4'. This event triggers the 'Large or small large quantity?' gateway, which has incoming 'ParallelGateway4' and outgoing 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Large or small large quantity?' gateway then leads to the 'Selection' task, with incoming 'Large or small large quantity?' and outgoing 'Ordering the forwarding'. The 'Ordering the forwarding' task has incoming 'Large or small large quantity?' and outgoing 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, with incoming 'ParallelGateway4' and outgoing'sid-97704466-3333-4AD2-BFB7-56F270B98D34'. The 'Packaging goods' task is followed by the 'Delivery of the goods for collection' task, with incoming 'Goods stand for shipping' and outgoing 'EndEvent0'.

The 'EndEvent0' then triggers the 'ParallelGateway7' task, with incoming'sid-6CC9244F-C6E3-48AC-864F-027C70017F8C' and 'Goods stand for shipping', and outgoing 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods stand for shipping' event, which leads to the 'Large or small large quantity?' gateway. This gateway then triggers the 'Selection' task, which in turn leads to the 'Ordering the forwarding' task. The 'Ordering the forwarding' task then leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, which is followed by the 'Delivery of the goods for collection' task. The process ends with the 'EndEvent0' task.
