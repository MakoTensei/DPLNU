 The workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Special shipment?' gateway, leading to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then connects to the 'Filling standard package voucher' task, which in turn links to the 'Packaging goods' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Special shipment?' gateway also connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway handles the 'Pick up Spediteur offers' task and subsequently links to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'ParallelGateway3' gateway is activated by the 'Special shipment?' gateway and connects to the 'Create a quote' task. This gateway also receives the 'Pick up Spediteur offers' task and links to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Insurance desired?' gateway, when triggered, leads to the 'Complete insurance' task.

The 'ParallelGateway6' gateway is activated by the 'StartEvent0' and connects to the'sid-26B57C66-8A90-4EA3-B870-C09094C9F0BB'.

The 'EndEvent0' is triggered by the 'Special shipment?' gateway and links back to the 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'EndEvent1' is triggered by the 'Provide goods for collection' task and links back to the'sid-3F2433B6-1D07-4BD1-8E03-19CB771FF870'.
