 In a seamless flow of communication, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating contact with the frontend, as denoted by the'sid-494E22E0-316B-4ACC-B869-629B207F5A9A' identifier. This event triggers the 'to the Fronend' gateway, identified by'sid-A922A1B4-5E29-4D98-9AF2-F42826926C54', which then leads to the 'first scoring (level 1)' task, signified by'sid-23456358-B6B5-4915-B6CE-30934B34412C'. The task is triggered by the 'Schufa request entered' event, which is routed through the 'EventBasedGateway0' ('sid-06288DD5-3AEF-4F9D-AD36-81928836CCAF') and subsequently reaches the 'ParallelGateway1' ('sid-4F277D2C-ACDA-42BB-9460-E6E09700E636'). This gateway is responsible for both the 'first scoring (level 1)' and 'Report result to the bank' tasks, as indicated by'sid-992764A7-739C-4657-A688-775647FBB3FE' and'sid-9004826F-D2BA-4934-869F-004F6CB4DA96' respectively. The 'Report result to the bank' task is triggered by the 'L1' event ('sid-4BDB97DD-22E0-4653-98BB-C7EC07936044') which is received from 'EventBasedGateway0' and leads to the 'Level 2' task ('sid-81F9144E
