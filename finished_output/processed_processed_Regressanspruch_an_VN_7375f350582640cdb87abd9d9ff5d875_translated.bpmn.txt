 The following tasks and gateways are part of a process flow:

1. The process begins with the event 'Insurance can be found in Regress we have taken'. This event triggers the 'justified?' gateway, which in turn sends the case to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

2. The 'ParallelGateway6' gateway is responsible for setting the process for re-submission.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway handles the case and sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

4. The 'Yellow ink' task is initiated when the 'Send payment request to VN' task is triggered. This task sends a payment request to VN and also sends the case to 'EndEvent0'.

5. The 'Opposition' task is triggered when the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway receives an incoming event. This task also sends the case to 'EndEvent0'.

6. The 'Reimbursement period expired' task is triggered when the 'EventBasedGateway4' gateway receives an incoming event. This task sends the case to 'EndEvent1'.

7. The process ends with 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' events.
