 When a scoring request is obtained, it triggers a process that begins with the ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway receives the incoming request and routes it to either the 'Scoring\nDebt\nLevel 1' task or the 'Determining scoring\nLevel 2' task, depending on the specifics of the request. The 'Scoring\nDebt\nLevel 1' task, identified by the ID'sid-0C27D470-748A-424F-80C9-B198DB091597', is then sent an inquiry with the ID'sid-599D2561-8937-4DF0-B078-C16B96BD8FAE'. Concurrently, the 'Determining scoring\nLevel 2' task, identified by the ID'sid-F0685134-EABE-48D5-A4DD-E716702221E7', is also sent an inquiry with the ID'sid-8FE4C9ED-6C85-46BD-8610-871559C39C96'. Both tasks are then forwarded to ExclusiveGateway1, which is identified by the ID'sid-C667924D-7C0B-4382-B9BB-3390EE01CC2B'. The ExclusiveGateway1 then sends the tasks to their respective next steps, with the 'Scoring\nDebt\nLevel 1' task being sent to the 'Scoring\nDebt\nLevel 1' task with the ID'sid-1D9F3175-247D-4F87-A033-785AB5C3AAC4', and the 'Determining scoring\nLevel 2' task being sent to the 'Determining scoring\nLevel 2' task with the ID'sid-9AFB9275-5939-44DC-9
