 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with checking the delivery at ParallelGateway3. The system then picks up offers, specifically looking for the cheapest one, which is facilitated by Specialist. Once the cheapest offer is chosen, the process continues with ExclusiveGateway2. Afterwards, the goods are packaged, and ParallelGateway5 is involved in this step.

Simultaneously, the goods are filled with a package note, which also involves ParallelGateway6. If insurance is deemed necessary, the process includes completing insurance through ParallelGateway6.

Finally, the goods are ready for collection, and the process concludes with ParallelGateway5.
