 In the process of handling a package, the workflow begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'Provide goods for collection' task. The goods are then picked up by a 'Pick up quotes' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Pick up quotes' task then connects to the 'Select a quote' task, which also receives input from 'ParallelGateway4'. Once a quote is selected, the 'Order' task is initiated, which receives input from 'Lot?'. The 'Order' task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which receives input from 'Lot?'. After the order is placed, the 'Insurance close' task is triggered, which receives input from 'Insurance?'. The 'Insurance close' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which receives input from both 'Insurance?' and 'ParallelGateway4'.

Following the insurance process, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway4'. The packaged goods are then sent to 'ParallelGateway5', which receives input from both 'Packaging goods' and 'ParallelGateway4'. Finally, the 'EndEvent0' task is triggered, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway5', marking the completion of the package handling process.
