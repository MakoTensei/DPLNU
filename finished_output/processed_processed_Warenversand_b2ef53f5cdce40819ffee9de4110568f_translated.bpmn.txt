 In the process of handling a transaction involving the sending of goods, the system initiates with the event 'Goods be sent', which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to process the transaction. This gateway, in turn, connects to the 'Big amount?' inquiry, leading to the selection of an offer from the 'Select your offer' gateway. Once the offer is selected, a 'Specialist' is engaged to handle the transaction.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods be sent' event also connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which is responsible for packaging the goods. The packaged goods are then sent to the 'ParallelGateway7', which is responsible for delivering the goods.

Upon successful delivery, the 'Goods be sent' event concludes with the 'Goods ready' event, signifying the completion of the transaction.
