 In a system designed to handle various tasks and events, the following workflow can be described:

1. When a 'Regress possible!' event occurs, it triggers the 'Regress authorized?' gateway. This gateway has two outcomes: 'Create a payment prompt' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'Create a payment prompt' task is initiated, and the 'EndEvent0' task is queued for later execution.

2. The 'Create a payment prompt' task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which has two outcomes: 'EndEvent0' and 'Checking the objection'. The 'EndEvent0' outcome is queued for later execution.

3. The 'Checking the objection' task is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which has two outcomes: 'EndEvent0' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'EndEvent0' outcome is queued for later execution.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' is also connected to the 'Relevance assessment' task, which has one outcome: 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' outcome is queued for later execution.

5. The 'Reimbursement' task is triggered by the 'Reimbursement' event and is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway4'. This gateway has three outcomes: 'Objection okay?', 'Debt collection', and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' outcome is queued for later execution.

6. The 'Debt collection' task is triggered by the 'Debt collection' event and is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway4'. This gateway has two outcomes: 'Objection okay?' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'EndEvent1' outcome is queued for later execution.

7. The 'Objection okay?' task is triggered by the 'Objection okay?' event and is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' outcome is queued for later execution.

8. The 'EndEvent0' task is triggered by the 'Regress authorized?' gateway and is connected to '
