 In the process of scoring requests, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring\nRequest\nReport' task, leading to the 'perform scoring level 1' task. This task is then followed by the 'Scoring\nLevel 1\nthe' task, which sends a report back to the 'EndEvent1'. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Report delay to Bank' task due to an incoming 'Instant\nInvestigation\npossible?' event. This task results in the 'Send notice of delay' event, which is then followed by the 'EndEvent2' task. Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, which eventually leads to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EventBasedGateway1' task is also triggered by 'StartEvent0', resulting in the 'EndEvent1' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' tasks. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task triggers the 'Send notice of delay' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent0'. Overall, the system handles scoring requests, reports, and potential delays in a structured manner, with various tasks and events interconnected to ensure smooth operation.
