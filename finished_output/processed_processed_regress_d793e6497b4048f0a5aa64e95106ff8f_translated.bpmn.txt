 In a financial processing system, a series of tasks and events are interconnected to manage the flow of operations. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Check the case' task. This task can lead to two possible outcomes: 'Reimbursement period expired' or 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'.

If the 'Reimbursement period expired', the system proceeds to the 'Reporting to debt collection office' task, which is an exclusive gateway that can only be reached from 'EventBasedGateway2'. Upon completion of this task, the system ends.

On the other hand, if 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' is triggered, the system moves to the 'Process closed' task, which also ends the process.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' can be reached from two sources: 'Check the case' and 'Reimbursement period expired'. If 'Check the case' is the source, the system goes to the 'Send a message' task, which can lead to 'on resubmission' and eventually to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. From 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', the system proceeds to the 'Accounting amount' task, which ends the process.

If 'Reimbursement period expired' is the source, the system directly goes to the 'Reporting to debt collection office' task, which ends the process.

The 'on resubmission' task can be reached from 'Send a message' and leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. From 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', the system goes to 'Accounting amount', which ends the process.

The 'Regress possible?' gateways can be reached from 'StartEvent0' and 'Check the case'. If 'Regress possible?' is triggered, the system goes to the 'Close' task, which ends the process.

In summary, the financial processing system starts with 'StartEvent0', which can lead to either 'Reimbursement period expired' or 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. Depending on the outcome, the system follows a series of tasks and events, ultimately ending the process.
