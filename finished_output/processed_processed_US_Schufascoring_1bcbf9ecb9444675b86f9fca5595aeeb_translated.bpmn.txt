 The process begins with the 'Schufaservice\nStart' event, which triggers the 'Exemption available?' gateway, leading to the 'Exemption available?' event. If the exemption is available, the process continues to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' event, where the'receiving results' and 'Delay message\nreceived' outcomes are generated. These outcomes then lead to the'receiving results' and 'Delay message\nreceived' events, respectively. The'receiving results' event then triggers the 'Schufascoring\ndetermined' event, which concludes the process.
