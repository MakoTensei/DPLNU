 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the picking up of offers from three carriers. This task is assigned to 'ParallelGateway4'. Once the offers are picked up, the process moves to 'Select your offer' where the customer decides whether to send large or small quantities. This decision is made at 'Gateway' with the ID'sid-B440C7E5-55BF-4110-88A7-AE75A25BB9CE'. Based on the quantity decision, the process diverges into two paths. If the customer chooses to send large quantities, the process continues to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the customer is asked if insurance is necessary. If the customer decides to send small quantities, the process moves to 'Specialist' at'sid-FB838580-2B21-438F-8F36-B2D64CB80E6D'.

For those who opt for insurance, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and then to 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, for those who choose small quantities, the process moves to 'Specialist' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. At 'ExclusiveGateway3', the process diverges again.

The process then moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the customer is asked if insurance is necessary. If the customer decides to insure the goods, the process moves to 'EndEvent0'.
