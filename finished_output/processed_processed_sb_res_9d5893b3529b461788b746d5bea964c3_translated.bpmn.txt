 When a guest expresses hunger, the system triggers a sequence of events to ensure they are served food in a court setting. The process begins with the 'Feeling hungry' event, which initiates the 'Money paid' event, informing the guest that payment is required. Following this, the 'Order Report' event is activated, leading to the 'Introduce' event, where the guest is introduced to the court.

The 'Introduce' event connects to the 'Guest Informed' event, prompting the 'Pick up food' event. This is where the guest is directed to select a court and then pick up their food. The 'Court Prepared' event signals the readiness of the court, which in turn triggers the 'Deliver food' event, ensuring the guest receives their meal.

Additionally, the 'Court Prepared' event also activates the '5 minutes' event, indicating a brief waiting period before the food is delivered. This sequence of events is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0', which oversees the transition between 'Court Prepared' and 'Deliver food', as well as the timing indicated by the '5 minutes' event.

In summary, the guest's hunger leads to a series of interconnected events and gateways that culminate in the selection of a court, payment, food pickup, and finally, the delivery of food, all while ensuring the court is prepared and the guest is informed of the waiting time.
