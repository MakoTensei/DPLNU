 Starting with the process of shipping goods, the journey begins at the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Choose your offer' task. This task is responsible for selecting the best offer for the shipping process.

Once the offer is chosen, the goods are then packaged, and the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway6', which further leads to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task is crucial for handling the specifics of the shipping process, such as customs and documentation.

Parallel to the packaging process, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which is essential for ensuring the goods are covered in case of any unforeseen incidents during transit. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7', which eventually leads to the 'Shipping order completed' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Filling the package note' task is also initiated, which is connected to the 'Type of shipping?' task. This task is responsible for filling out the necessary information about the shipping method and other relevant details.

In summary, the process of shipping goods involves several tasks and gateways, including choosing the best offer, packaging the goods, completing insurance, and filling the package note. These tasks are interconnected through various gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient shipping process.
