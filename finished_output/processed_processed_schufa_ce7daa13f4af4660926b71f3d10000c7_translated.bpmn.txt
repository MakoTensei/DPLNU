 In the scoring process, a request for scoring questions is initiated by the 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event, which triggers the 'Delay\nReport\nobtained' event. This report is then passed to the 'Result\nobtained' event, which in turn dispatches the 'Result\ndispatched' event. The scoring process begins with the '1. Scoring\nperform' task, which receives a request and dispatches a result. This result is then passed to the 'Result\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. The 'Two. Scoring\nperform' task, which also receives a request, is then dispatched to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task receives both 'Two. Scoring\nperform' and '1. Scoring\nperform' tasks and dispatches the 'Result\ndispatched' event. Meanwhile, the 'Result\nobtained' event also triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' task, which receives the 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event and dispatches the 'Delay\nReport\nobtained' event. The 'Delay\nReport\nobtained' event is then passed to the 'Result\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'Result\ndispatched' event.
