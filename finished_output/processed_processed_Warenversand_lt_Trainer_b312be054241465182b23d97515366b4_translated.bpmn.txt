 The shipping process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task. This task is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway4', which receives the incoming 'Shipping goods' and sends outgoing tasks to 'Select a quote' and 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers'. The 'Select a quote' task is then handled by 'ExclusiveGateway0', which receives the incoming 'Select a quote' and sends outgoing tasks to 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' task, also receiving from 'ExclusiveGateway0', sends outgoing tasks to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task also sends outgoing tasks to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which receives the incoming 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' and sends outgoing tasks to 'Filling the package note' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Filling the package note' task, receiving from 'ExclusiveGateway1', sends outgoing tasks to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Filling the package note' task is then followed by the 'Complete insurance' task, which also receives from 'ExclusiveGateway1' and sends outgoing tasks to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Meanwhile, the 'Select a quote' task sends outgoing tasks to 'Specialist', which receives from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends outgoing tasks to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, receiving from both 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway0', sends outgoing tasks to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task, receiving from both 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway1', sends outgoing tasks to 'Prepare for shipment'.

Finally, the 'Prepare for shipment' event is triggered, marking the end of the shipping process.
