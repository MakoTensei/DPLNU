 The process begins with the 'Send a message' start event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task through the 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Pick up offers' task then connects to the 'Select your offer' task via 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Once the offer is selected, the 'Select your offer' task links to the 'Specialist' task through 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Specialist' task concludes the process by reaching the 'EndEvent0' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Simultaneously, the 'Send a message' start event also initiates the 'Determine the quantity' task through 'ParallelGateway3'. This task connects to the 'Filling the package note' task via 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Filling the package note' task then links to the 'Provide for collection' task through 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Provide for collection' task concludes the process by reaching the 'EndEvent0' through 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Pick up offers' task also triggers the 'Insurance close' task through 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Insurance close' task connects to the 'ParallelGateway4' task via 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ParallelGateway4' task concludes the process by reaching the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process involves multiple tasks and gateways, with the 'Send a message' start event initiating the 'Pick up offers' and 'Determine the quantity' tasks. The 'Pick up offers' task connects to the 'Select your offer' and 'Insurance close' tasks, while the 'Determine the quantity' task links to the 'Filling the package note' and 'Provide for collection' tasks. All tasks ultimately reach the 'EndEvent0' through various gateways.
