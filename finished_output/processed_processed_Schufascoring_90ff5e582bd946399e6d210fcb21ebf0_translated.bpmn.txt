 When a Schufa request is initiated, it triggers the 'Start scoring request' task, which sends the request to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and subsequently to the 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, the 'Conduct Level 1' task is activated, directing the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then leads to 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, the 'Conduct Level 2' task also receives the request and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn connects to 'EndEvent1'. Upon completion of these tasks, the 'Send result to Frontend' task is executed, delivering the final result to the frontend.
