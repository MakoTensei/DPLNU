 The process begins with a shipment necessity event, which triggers the selection of an offer through the Special Delivery Gateway, leading to the ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway then directs the process to fill out standard package tickets via InclusiveGateway2. The filled package tickets are then sent to InclusiveGateway3, which in turn sends the package to ParallelGateway4. From ParallelGateway4, the goods are picked up for collection and sent to ParallelGateway5. Finally, the goods are made available for shipping through ParallelGateway5, completing the process.
