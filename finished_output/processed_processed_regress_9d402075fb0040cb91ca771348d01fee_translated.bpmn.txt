 In the event of an insurance taken in regression, the system initiates a series of checks and actions to handle the situation. First, it checks for a possible regression, which could lead to a denial of payment upon arrival. If a denial is detected, the system sets up a process for resubmission. Concurrently, a payment request is sent to Vietnam to address the issue.

If the insurance taken in regression is confirmed, the system shares the information with the debt collection office. Once all the necessary actions are completed, the process is closed.

When a payment is received, the system checks for a possible regression again. If no regression is found, the process ends.

In the case of an expired reimbursement period, the system directs the process to ExclusiveGateway3.

The process begins with the event 'Insurance taken in Regress' and ends with 'EndEvent0'. The system uses ExclusiveGateway2 to handle the flow of events, ensuring that each task is executed in the correct order and that the appropriate outcomes are achieved.
