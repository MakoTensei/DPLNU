 When a scoring request is initiated, the process begins with the 'Schufascoring requested' event, which triggers the 'Waiting for scoring result' gateway to send a 'Send delay' to the 'Schufascoring' service. Once the scoring request is processed, the 'Result of scoring request' is generated and sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then sends a 'Send a reply' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Result of scoring request' and 'Create a service request' events, and sends a 'Send a reply' to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Finally, the 'Schufascoring' service completes the scoring process, resulting in the 'Schufascoring finished' event, which is received by 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
