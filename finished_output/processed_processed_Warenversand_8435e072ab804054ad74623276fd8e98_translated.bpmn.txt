 When a request for goods is made, the process begins with the 'Goods requested' event, which triggers the incoming pathways to ParallelGateway4 and ParallelGateway5. ParallelGateway4 is responsible for packaging the goods, while ParallelGateway5 handles the delivery.

ParallelGateway4 receives the incoming request and sends the goods to Packaging goods, which in turn sends the goods to ParallelGateway4. Once the goods are packaged, ParallelGateway4 sends the goods to Goods Pickup made available.

ParallelGateway5 receives the incoming request and sends the goods to Goods Pickup made available.

In parallel, the 'Filling the package note' task, with the ID sid-A5E1BFF1-A2EF-4B52-AF3A-9FAAB61E7F45, is triggered by the incoming pathway from ParallelGateway3. This task is responsible for filling the package note.

Simultaneously, the 'Delivering goods' task, with the ID sid-2F702044-820A-4818-9F2F-5318691D37A3, is triggered by the incoming pathway from ParallelGateway5. This task handles the delivery of the goods.

Lastly, the 'Packaging goods' task, with the ID sid-2B3D4223-C229-422E-BA6F-366A845DA0A2, is triggered by the incoming pathway from Goods requested. This task is responsible for packaging the goods.

In summary, the process begins with the request for goods, which triggers the packaging and delivery tasks. The 'Filling the package note' task is also triggered in parallel, ensuring that the package note is filled before the goods are delivered.
