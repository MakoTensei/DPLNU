 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with a special shipment inquiry at ExclusiveGateway3, which then leads to ParallelGateway5. At ParallelGateway5, the goods are packaged and the packaging note is filled. Following this, the goods are insured, and the insurance is explained to the customer. After the insurance is confirmed, the goods are sent out. Throughout this process, the customer is presented with the option to choose the cheapest offer for the shipment, and if special compensation is required, the proceedings are handled at ExclusiveGateway3. The entire process concludes with the goods being sent out to the customer.
