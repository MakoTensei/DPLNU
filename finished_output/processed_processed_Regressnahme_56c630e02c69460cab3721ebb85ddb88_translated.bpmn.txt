 Upon receiving a notification of a possible regression, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, a task is created to check the case, which inquires if a regression is possible. If the answer is affirmative, a task is set up to send a payment request for the potential regression. Concurrently, the system also prepares a process for resubmission, which is triggered by the same notification.

Once the payment request is sent, the system sets up a process for resubmission, which includes a gateway for exclusive handling. If the case is deemed to have a possible regression, the system proceeds to the ExclusiveGateway1, which leads to the successful handover of the case.

In the event that the case is not a regression, the system moves to the 'Close' task, which can be triggered by an objection or the successful handling of the case. If the case is closed, the system then proceeds to the 'Case handed over' task, which is triggered by the successful handling of the case.

Throughout this process, the system also handles other events such as 'Money received' and 'Objection', which can lead to different outcomes based on the incoming and outgoing tasks.

In summary, the system efficiently manages the possible regression notification by initiating a series of tasks and gateways, ensuring a smooth and successful handling of the case.
