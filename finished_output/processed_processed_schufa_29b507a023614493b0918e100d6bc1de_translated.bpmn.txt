 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'inform sales staff' task. This task is then followed by the 'Scoring request' task, which leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' then sends the 'Level 1' task to the 'Frontend'.

The 'Frontend' completes the 'Level 1' task and sends the 'Level 1 sent' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway then triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which in turn leads to the 'Preparing results for Frontend' task.

The 'Preparing results for Frontend' task sends the 'EndEvent0' event, which is then followed by the 'Level 1' task in the'sid-ED65D67D-31D2-432E-85D9-2E1DF16F8F4E' gateway. The 'Level 1' task completes and sends the 'EndEvent2' event.

The 'Level 1 successful?' event in the'sid-18B70DBE-74AF-48F3-8803-12606E3B4416' gateway triggers the 'Level 1 answer request' task, which then sends the 'EndEvent3' event.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent1' task triggers the 'Level 1' task in the'sid-C408531B-A28C-4CE4-84B9-7AE9C169B263' gateway. This task completes and sends the 'EndEvent2' event.

The 'Level 1 successful?' event in the'sid-192C60A2-9358-4AA0-807F-F9BDD6E72376' gateway triggers the 'Level 2 Confirm request' task, which then sends the 'EndEvent2' event.
