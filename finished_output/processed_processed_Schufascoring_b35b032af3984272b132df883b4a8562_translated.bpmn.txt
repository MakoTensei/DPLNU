 The system initiates a process with the event 'Sufa required', which triggers the 'Show delay' task. This task is dependent on the 'Sufa required' event and leads to the 'Final result obtained' task. The 'Final result obtained' task, in turn, sends the 'Result obtained' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which determines the 'Schufa determined' outcome.

Simultaneously, the 'Investigation Mission' event kicks off the 'Report the result' task. This task is dependent on the 'Investigation Mission' event and results in the 'Reported' outcome. The 'Reported' outcome is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task is triggered by the 'Scoring final?' event, which is dependent on the 'Investigation Mission' event. This task sends the 'Scoring final?' to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then sends the 'Reported' outcome to the 'Reported' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Sufa required' event also triggers the 'Delay obtained' task, which sends the 'Delay obtained' to 'Schufa determined'. The 'Schufa determined' outcome is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which leads to the 'Schufa determined' task.

In summary, the system processes the 'Sufa required' and 'Investigation Mission' events, which lead to the 'Schufa determined' and 'Reported' outcomes, respectively. These outcomes are then sent to their respective exclusive gateways, which further process the results and send them to the final tasks.
