 When an order comes in, the process begins with the Etiketiere (labeling) task, which checks if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, the Insurance close task is triggered, and the process continues to the ParallelGateway3. If insurance is not required, the process moves directly to the Packaging goods task. Regardless of the insurance decision, the order then proceeds to the Packaging and shipping task, which also connects to the ParallelGateway3. After packaging and shipping, the process concludes with the EndEvent0, marking the completion of the order's transportation process.
