 In the scoring process, the system handles various tasks and events to ensure efficient processing and communication. Here's a natural flow description of the system's operations:

1. When a scoring request with a Schufa report arrives, it is forwarded to the 'Scoring 1 result forward' gateway, which sends a 'Scoring 1 result' to the next stage.

2. The 'Scoring 1 result' is then sent to the 'Scoring 1 Calculate result' gateway, which checks if the results are available. If available, it sends a 'Scoring 2 result forward' message to the next stage.

3. If the results are not available, the 'Scoring 1 Calculate result' gateway sends a 'forward delay' message to the 'Scoring 2 result forward' gateway, which waits for the results to become available.

4. Once the results are available, the 'Scoring 2 result forward' gateway sends a 'Scoring 2 result' to the 'Scoring 2 Calculate result' gateway, which then sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Results available?' gateway.

5. The 'Results available?' gateway checks if the results are available and sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring 2 request forward' gateway if they are, or a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring 2 request forward' gateway if they are not.

6. The 'Scoring 2 request forward' gateway sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring 2 result forward' gateway, which sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring 2 result forward' gateway.

7. The 'Scoring 2 result forward' gateway sends a 'Scoring 2 result' to the 'Scoring request' gateway, which then sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring request\nFinished' gateway.

8. The 'Scoring request\nFinished' gateway sends a 'Scoring request\nFinished' message to the 'Scoring request' gateway, completing the process.
