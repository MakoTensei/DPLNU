 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Offers enroll' task to determine if the quantity is significant. This task connects to 'Quantity big?' gateway, which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Once the offer is selected, the 'freight forwarders commission' task is initiated, which also connects to 'Quantity big?' gateway, leading to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods be sent' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which connects to 'Quantity big?' gateway, leading to 'Insurance Check'. The 'Insurance Check' task then connects to 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Insurance Check' task also connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway is also connected to 'Goods for collection provide' task, which leads to 'Goods dispatched'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers multiple tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Goods dispatched' event. The process involves determining the quantity, selecting an offer, calculating commissions, checking for insurance, and dispatching the goods.
