 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway receives the 'Shipping costs' and forwards it to 'ParallelGateway5'. Simultaneously, 'Shipping costs' also triggers 'ExclusiveGateway3', which sends the 'Insurance required?' to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Next, 'ParallelGateway4' receives 'Shipping costs' and sends it to 'ParallelGateway5' for 'Package delivery' and to 'Specialist' for 'Pick up offers'. The 'Specialist' then sends the 'Quantity' to 'ParallelGateway5'.

'ParallelGateway5' receives 'Quantity' from 'Specialist' and 'ParallelGateway4' and sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Determining quantities' event, triggered by 'Shipping costs', sends 'Quantity' to 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway then sends 'ParallelGateway5' for 'Specialist' and 'Packaging goods'.

'Specialist' receives 'Quantity' from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends it to 'ParallelGateway5' for 'EndEvent0'.

Finally, 'Packaging goods' event sends 'ParallelGateway4' to 'ParallelGateway5' for 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'Shipping costs', which triggers 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Specialist' then handle 'Package delivery' and 'Pick up offers' respectively. The 'Determining quantities' event sends 'Quantity' to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn sends it to 'Specialist' and 'Packaging goods'. The process ends with 'EndEvent0', receiving 'ParallelGateway5' from all involved gateways.
