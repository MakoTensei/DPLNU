 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the pickup of offers from three companies, which involves checking the quantity of shipment. This task then transitions to 'ExclusiveGateway2', where the offers are selected and commission forwarders are chosen. Concurrently, the 'Insurance necessary' task is triggered, which also passes through 'ExclusiveGateway2' and leads to the completion of insurance. Meanwhile, the 'Checking the quantity of shipment' task, which originates from 'ParallelGateway3', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and also triggers the 'filling standard shipping document' task. After the insurance is completed, the process moves to 'ParallelGateway4', where the goods are packaged and prepared for collection. Finally, the process concludes with 'EndEvent0', which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4'.
