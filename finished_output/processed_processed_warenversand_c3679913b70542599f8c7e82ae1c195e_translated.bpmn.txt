 In the e-commerce process, the following tasks are performed in a specific sequence:

1. The process starts with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then routes the process to either 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

2. If the process goes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', it triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5'. 'ParallelGateway4' further routes the process to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'Product is provided'. 'ParallelGateway5' leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

3. If the process goes to 'ExclusiveGateway3', it triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5' as well. However, 'ParallelGateway5' leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

4. The 'ParallelGateway7' is a common gateway for both paths and routes the process to the 'EndEvent0'.

5. The 'Product is provided' event signifies the completion of the product provisioning process.

6. The 'EndEvent0' signifies the completion of the entire e-commerce process.

In summary, the e-commerce process starts with 'StartEvent0', which routes to either 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'ExclusiveGateway3'. From there, the process goes through various parallel gateways and ends with 'EndEvent0'. The 'Product is provided' event signifies the completion of the product provisioning process.
