 In the process of handling a regression claim, the following sequence of tasks and gateways are triggered:

1. A regression claim is reported, initiating the process with the task 'Send payment request to VN' (sid-88D397EC-47C8-435F-8E80-16D4A1D2A095). This task is set to send a payment request to Vietnam.

2. The 'Send payment request to VN' task triggers the 'Regression possibility is there?' gateway (sid-BEA138E5-4A63-46D8-832C-2B5452EA1DC1). This gateway checks if there is a possibility of regression.

3. If the 'Regression possibility is there?' gateway determines that there is a possibility of regression, it sends the 'Opposition justified?' gateway (sid-95672DF5-0423-4D0B-BFCC-34439031F923). This gateway assesses if the opposition is justified.

4. If the 'Opposition justified?' gateway determines that the opposition is justified, it sends the 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-0CC1F3A1-235C-451B-948E-D7ACC13711D3). This gateway proceeds with the process.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' (sid-0CC1F3A1-235C-451B-948E-D7ACC13711D3) sends the 'Process completed' task (sid-D6620E32-6C62-452E-8BEC-756955BB27A1) if the opposition is justified.

6. If the 'Regression possibility is there?' gateway determines that there is no possibility of regression, it sends the 'Set process for resubmission' task (sid-sid-837112DA-9A1F-4
