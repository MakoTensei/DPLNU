 In the shipping process, the workflow begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'fill out standard package tickets' task. This task is initiated by the 'ParallelGateway2' and leads to the 'Determine scior' task, which is triggered by the 'Shipping quantity?' task. The 'Determine scior' task then connects to 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Goods delivered' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Shipping quantity?' task, triggered by 'Shipping goods', also connects to 'Pick up a quote for forwarders' task, which is initiated by 'Special offer' and leads to 'Special offer' task. This task is triggered by 'Shipping quantity?' and connects to 'Order' task, which is initiated by 'Compare prices' task. The 'Compare prices' task is triggered by 'Special offer' and connects to 'Order' task.

Additionally, the 'Insurance necessary?' task, triggered by 'Shipping quantity?', connects to 'Insurance close' task, which is initiated by 'Insurance necessary?' and connects to 'ParallelGateway3'.

In summary, the shipping process involves several tasks and gateways, including 'fill out standard package tickets', 'Determine scior', 'Pick up a quote for forwarders', 'Special offer', 'Compare prices', and 'Insurance close'. These tasks and gateways work together to determine the quantity of goods, provide quotes for forwarders, compare prices, and handle insurance requirements, ultimately leading to the 'Goods delivered' event.
