 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and conversational way:

1. When a guest feels hungry, they trigger the "Hunger felt" event. This leads to the guest adding their order to the system.

2. The guest receives an "Order Report" confirming their order. This event then triggers the retrieval of the guest's information.

3. The kitchen receives the "Cooking order obtained" notification, which prompts the staff to prepare the meal.

4. Once the meal is prepared, the kitchen staff informs the employees about the completion of the cooking order.

5. The guest experiences satisfaction and no longer feels hungry. This event is called "Hunger distilled."

6. The guest's order is completed, and they are notified that it's ready. This event is called "Order finished."

7. The kitchen staff is informed that the cooking order has been finished, and they can now serve the meal.

8. The guest enjoys their meal, and the process concludes with the guest's satisfaction.
