 To describe the flow of the described process in a more natural, one-line description, we can summarize the sequence of events as follows:

A guest arrives at the restaurant, triggering a series of events that lead to the preparation and delivery of their meal. The process begins with the guest's hunger being acknowledged, followed by the order being placed with Koch. The meal is then prepared and put in the kitchen, and a Pieper signal is sent to indicate its readiness. The guest is then notified to pick up their meal from the counter, where they receive it. After eating, the guest's satisfaction is reported to Koch, and the process concludes with the guest leaving the restaurant.
