 The process begins with a 'Regression' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request to VN' task. This task is then followed by the 'Check the case' task, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If the case is justified, the process moves to the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which then leads to the 'Payment confirmed' task. This task sends the payment confirmation to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn leads to the 'Process' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Opposition Report' event triggers the 'Proceedings' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If the opposition report is justified, the process moves to the 'forwarded' task, which is connected to 'EventBasedGateway4'.

Finally, the 'Process' task is completed, marking the end of the process.
