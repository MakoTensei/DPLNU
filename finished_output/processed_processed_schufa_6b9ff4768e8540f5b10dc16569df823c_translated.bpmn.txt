 To create a scoring request to Schufa and obtain the scoring result, the following sequence of tasks and gateways is executed:

1. The process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' start event, which triggers the 'Scoring\nFollow-up' task with the ID'sid-5964848A-EF2D-4178-843C-F043B5E34F83'. This task sends a request to Schufa and awaits the completion of the scoring process.

2. Once the scoring process is initiated, the 'perform scoring level 1' task with the ID'sid-6406E2FA-553A-42A9-AB6B-E5985BC3E849' is executed. This task checks the success of the scoring level 1 and sends the result to the 'Scoring Level 1\nsuccessful?' gateway with the ID'sid-178F5267-D355-4393-9120-AEF2263F8343'.

3. If the scoring level 1 is successful, the gateway sends the 'Scoring\ncompleted' message to the 'Send Scoring Result' task with the ID'sid-20484965-C7DA-4132-B38B-B361EA00BA00'. This task then sends the scoring result to Schufa.

4. If the scoring level 1 is not successful, the gateway sends the 'Scoring Level 2\nperform' message to the 'Scoring Level 2\nperform' task with the ID'sid-FDDF8014-46F3-4A08-B07D-CFE659EE695B'. This task initiates the scoring process for level 2.

5. The 'Scoring Level 2\nperform' task sends the result to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' with the ID'sid-519F5386-C9F2
