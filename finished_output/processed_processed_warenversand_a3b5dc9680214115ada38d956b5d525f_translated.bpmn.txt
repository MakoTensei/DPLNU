 The Secretariat explains who takes over shipping when necessary, and this process begins with the StartEvent0. The ParallelGateway4 receives the incoming event and routes it to the InclusiveGateway3 and ParallelGateway5. The InclusiveGateway3, in turn, receives the incoming event from the Is special shipment necessary? and routes it to the ExclusiveGateway1. The ExclusiveGateway1 receives the incoming event from the ParallelGateway4 and the Insurance necessary? and routes it to the ParallelGateway5.

The ParallelGateway5 receives the incoming events from the Filling the package note and the ParallelGateway4, and it routes them to the EndEvent0. The EndEvent0 receives the incoming event from the ParallelGateway5 and completes the process.

The InclusiveGateway3 routes the Is special shipment necessary? event to the ExclusiveGateway1. The ExclusiveGateway1 routes the Insurance necessary? event to the ParallelGateway5. The ParallelGateway5 receives the Filling the package note and ParallelGateway4 events and routes them to the EndEvent0. The EndEvent0 completes the process by receiving the ParallelGateway5 event.
