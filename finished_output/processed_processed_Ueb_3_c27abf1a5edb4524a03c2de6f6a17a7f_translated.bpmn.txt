 The process begins with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then checks if there is a possibility of a regression. If there is, the process moves to 'Set process on WV', where the process is set on the 'WV' system. The 'Money received' task follows, indicating that money has been received, and it leads to the 'Process successful\nclosed' task, marking the successful completion of the process.

If there is no possibility of regression, the 'Opposition Report' event is triggered, which sends the report to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then checks if there is a possibility of a case without a result. If there is, the process moves to 'Case without result\nclosed', marking the closure of the case.

Alternatively, if the 'Opposition Report' event leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3', the process checks if there is a possibility of a case without a result. If there is, the process moves to 'Case without result\nclosed'.

In the case of a 'Reimbursement period expired' event, the process is forwarded to 'Case of debt collection\nforwarded', which is handled by 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which can lead to different outcomes based on the possibility of a regression. The process involves multiple tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the process or the closure of a case without a result.
