 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring request' task. This task sends a 'Scoring result\nreceived' message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends an 'EndEvent0' message.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Send delay message' task. This task sends a 'Delay message\nreceived' message to 'EventBasedGateway2'. The 'EventBasedGateway2' then sends an 'EndEvent1' message.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Determine scoring availability' task. This task sends an 'EndEvent2' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Scoring request' task is then followed by the 'Send scoring result' task, which sends a 'Scoring result\nLevel 2\nreceived' message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which sends a 'Level 1 Scoring' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Level 1 Scoring' task is then followed by the 'Send delay message' task, which sends a 'Level 2 Scoring' message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This triggers the 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which sends a 'Send Level 2 scoring' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Finally, the 'Level 2 Scoring' task sends a 'EndEvent1' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', and the 'Send delay message' task sends an 'EndEvent1' message to 'EventBasedGateway2'. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent1' message being sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
