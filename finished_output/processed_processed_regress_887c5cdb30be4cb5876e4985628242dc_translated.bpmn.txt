 The process begins with the 'VN mglw. regressive' event, which triggers the 'Check regression case' task. This task sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then forwards the message to 'EndEvent1'. 

Simultaneously, the 'VN mglw. regressive' event also triggers the 'Send a reply' task. This task sends a reply to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then forwards the message to 'EndEvent1'.

After 'EndEvent1' is reached, the 'Reimbursement' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task receives a message from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends a message to 'Reimbursement period'.

Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway2' also receives a message from 'EventBasedGateway4' and forwards it to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Book money receipt' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2' when it receives a message from 'Money received'. This task sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then forwards the message to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Proceedings' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2' when it receives a message from 'VN objection received'. This task sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then forwards the message to 'EndEvent0'.

Finally, 'EndEvent0' is reached, and the process ends.
