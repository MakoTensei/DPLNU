 In the world of financial data processing, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure the timely and accurate scoring of debts. The process begins with a scoring request by Schufa, which triggers a chain of events and interactions between various tasks and gateways.

The first task,'sid-F87CFFFC-C221-4927-9EBB-01DED370965E', named 'Schufascoring the Debt', initiates the process by sending the incoming data to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway,'sid-346CA9AC-0CB1-42A2-BA48-89B5DAC9277B', then processes the data and determines the scoring result.

Meanwhile, another task,'sid-562ECE47-1FFD-471C-A5A2-6E3E3EB5EFE4', named 'Scoring request arrived', receives the incoming data and sends it to 'Scoring?', the gateway responsible for determining the next steps in the process.

As the scoring process continues,'sid-0DF0B6E6-DEC7-4214-9AF2-DBC0CE9C0C1D', named 'ExclusiveGateway3', receives the results and sends a reply to'sid-5A453477-1744-40B0-B39B-0945489BA9DD', which is responsible for forwarding the results to the frontend.

In parallel,'sid-6FC5B9C0-CA48-4CC7-A203-BB2EA4EB6587', named 'Report delay', receives the incoming data from 'Schufascoring the Debt' and sends a delayed result to 'Delayed Result arrived', which then forwards the results to the frontend.

The process also includes a second level of scoring,'sid-809EC842-F37C-4DAB-91D2-5107AC
