 In the process of scoring and request handling, a series of interconnected tasks and gateways work together to ensure the smooth flow of information. The journey begins with a 'Request Report' event, which triggers the 'Scoring Request Trigger' task (sid-9512465D-8DE8-4F0D-AA5C-49A3F85A6929). This task then forwards the results to the 'Result Forward' gateway (sid-9F4A6582-989F-47F2-928E-B04364A4BE0C), which in turn sends the results to the 'End Event 0' (sid-9A50AFBD-05A5-4C10-8862-6C05C4589BC0).

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring Request Trigger' task also sends the 'Request Report' to the 'Level 1 Follow Me?' gateway (sid-3BF91B43-42AA-4E1D-AB16-3274D70E6B2D), which forwards the request to both the 'Exclusive Gateway 1' (sid-B26F33C1-A5DF-470A-8AB9-3E510DAE988C) and the 'Scoring Perform 1' task (sid-6500DC9C-2FD8-42FA-BF62-9C6DC8E93D93). The 'Scoring Perform 1' task then sends the results to the 'End Event 1' (sid-2A780DDA-9326-46A5-BCCC-368C43DEC9C6).

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Perform 2' task (sid-9199BF28-F6A3-42D8-94B8-54CEF74F0D0E) also sends the 'Request Report' to the 'Exclusive Gate
