 When an order is received, the process begins with checking the quantity of items in the order, which is then sent to ParallelGateway4. Following this, the packaging of the goods is initiated, which also involves ParallelGateway4. Concurrently, a request for a quote is made to select a shipping service, leading to the selection of a Spediteur. The Spediteur is then connected to Specialist, who in turn connects to ExclusiveGateway1.

Once the lot is confirmed, the process moves to checking the insurance for the shipment, which is then sent to ParallelGateway5. After the insurance is confirmed, the process proceeds to complete the insurance, which connects to ExclusiveGateway3.

Simultaneously, the goods are being packaged, and the packaging process is also connected to ParallelGateway5. Once the insurance is complete, the process moves to providing for collection, which connects to Shipping costs and Finished.

In summary, the order to receive triggers a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, including checking quantity, packaging, requesting a quote, selecting a shipping service, checking insurance, completing insurance, and providing for collection. These tasks and gateways work together to ensure a smooth and efficient order fulfillment process.
