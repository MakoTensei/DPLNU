 In a complex system involving various tasks and gateways, the following sequence of events and tasks can be described:

1. The process starts with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'Take VN to Regress?' gateway. This gateway has two outgoing paths:'sid-4379241F-2CB3-4908-826D-CDBC8A87EEF6' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Proceedings' task from the 'Start' event and sends it to 'End'.

6. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' also receives the 'Debt collection agency' task from the 'EventBasedGateway6' and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Money received\n' task from the 'Set on re-submission' task and sends it to 'End'.

8. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' also receives the 'Representation-Frist' task from the 'EventBasedGateway6' and sends it to 'End'.

9. The 'ExclusiveGateway4' receives the 'VN' task from the 'EventBasedGateway6' and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
