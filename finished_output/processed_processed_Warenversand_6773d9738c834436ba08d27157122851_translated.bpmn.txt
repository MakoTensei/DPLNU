 In a bustling marketplace, a series of tasks are carried out to ensure the smooth operation of the event. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the pick-up of offers, which are then presented to the 'Select your offer' gateway. This gateway, in turn, connects to the 'Specialist' gateway, which handles the situation when a 'Big crowd?' event occurs. The 'Specialist' gateway then leads to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the offer selection process.

Simultaneously, the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway receives the 'StartEvent0' and directs the crowd to the 'Pick up offers' gateway. The 'Pick up offers' gateway then connects to the 'Select your offer' gateway, continuing the process of offer selection.

Meanwhile, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' event, which is handled by the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then leads to the 'EndEvent0', signaling the completion of the package note filling process.

The 'Packaging goods' task is initiated by the 'ParallelGateway4' and is directed to the 'ParallelGateway5', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the packaging process.

Lastly, the 'Provide merchandise for collection' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway5' and leads to the 'EndEvent0', signaling the completion of the merchandise collection process.

Throughout this process, the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateways play crucial roles in handling insurance requirements and ensuring the smooth flow of tasks. The 'ParallelGateway5' serves as a central hub, connecting various tasks and gateways to ensure the event runs efficiently.
