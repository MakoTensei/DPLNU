 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4'. This leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which in turn connects to the 'Special shipment?' gateway. The 'Special shipment?' gateway then connects to the 'Select your offer' task. The 'Select your offer' task connects to the 'Specialist' task, which then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Insurance required' gateway also connects to the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is the endpoint for the 'Delivering goods' task.

The 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to the 'Packaging goods' task, which in turn connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' is the endpoint for the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', which leads to 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the process branches out to 'Filling the package note', 'Select your offer', 'Specialist', and 'Packaging goods'. The 'Special shipment?' gateway connects to 'Select your offer' and 'Specialist', while the 'Insurance required' gateway connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which is the endpoint for 'Delivering goods' and 'EndEvent0'.
