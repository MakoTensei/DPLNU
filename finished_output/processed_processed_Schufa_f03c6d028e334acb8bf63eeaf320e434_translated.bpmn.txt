 In the scoring process, a Scoring order initiates the sequence by sending a Scoring order event to the EventBasedGateway2. This event triggers the ExclusiveGateway1, which then directs the Scoring Level 1 to the ExclusiveGateway1. The Scoring Level 1, upon completion, sends a Scoring result back to the EventBasedGateway2, which in turn sends an EndEvent0.

Simultaneously, the Scoring order event also triggers a Report delay event, which is sent to the EventBasedGateway2. This event then leads to the Scoring Level 2 being directed to the ExclusiveGateway1. The Scoring Level 2, upon completion, sends a Scoring result back to the ExclusiveGateway1, which then sends an EndEvent1.

Meanwhile, the Scoring Level 1 event also triggers an Information on Delay event, which is sent to the EventBasedGateway2. This event then leads to the EndEvent0.

In summary, the Scoring order event initiates the scoring process, triggering a series of events and interactions between the different gateways and end events. The process involves the Scoring Level 1 and Scoring Level 2, as well as the Report delay event, all working together to ensure the scoring process is completed successfully.
