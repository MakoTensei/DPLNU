 The process begins with a 'Request\nSales staff' event, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1' to send an 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent0' to their respective outgoing paths. The 'StartEvent1' then initiates the 'Delay\nReport' event, which in turn sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This event is also responsible for triggering the 'Scoring\nparts' task, which sends an 'EndEvent0' to its outgoing path.

The 'Scoring\nparts' task is then followed by the 'Delay\nReport' event, which sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This event triggers the 'Scoring\nparts' task again, sending an 'EndEvent1' to its outgoing path.

The 'Delay\nReport' event also sends a 'Result\navailable?' event to the 'Result\navailable?' gateway, which in turn sends an 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3' to their respective outgoing paths.

In summary, the process involves a series of events and tasks that are triggered and completed in a specific order, with each event and task having its own incoming and outgoing paths. The 'EventBasedGateway1' plays a crucial role in managing the flow of events and tasks, ensuring that they are executed in the correct order and that the necessary information is passed between them.
