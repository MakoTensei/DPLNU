 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the 'Executing Schufascoring Process'. This process then triggers the 'Results available?' event, which leads to the 'Level 1 scoring' process. The 'Level 1 scoring' process, in turn, triggers the 'Results available?' event again, resulting in the 'EndEvent1'. Following this, the 'Level 2 scoring' process is initiated, which also triggers the 'Results available?' event, leading to the 'EndEvent2'. The 'Pick up Schufascoring and view results' process is then initiated by 'StartEvent2', which triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1'. Finally, the 'EndEvent3' concludes the process.
