 When a notification of regression is received, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, the 'Regression possibility' gateway is triggered, which then leads to the 'Check regression' task. This task evaluates the possibility of a regression and, if confirmed, sends a notification to the 'Debt collection' gateway.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression possibility' gateway also sends a notification to the 'Notification' event, which in turn closes the 'Notification of regression' task.

If the 'Check regression' task determines that a regression has occurred, it proceeds to the 'Set to reimbursement' task. This task sends a message to the'set to reimbursement' gateway, which then closes the 'Regression possibility' gateway and submits the reimbursement request.

Meanwhile, the 'Debt collection' gateway receives the notification and triggers the 'Debt collection' task. This task submits the debt collection request to the 'Submitted' gateway.

If the 'Debt collection' task is successful, the 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway is triggered, which then closes the 'Notification of regression' task and the 'Notification' event.

In the case of receiving money, the 'Money received' event is triggered, which then closes the 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway and the 'Notification of regression' task.

Overall, the system efficiently manages the notification of regression by coordinating various tasks and gateways to ensure timely and accurate handling of the issue.
