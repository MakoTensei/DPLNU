 A guest feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they select a dish to order. The order is then retrieved by the restaurant staff and sent to the kitchen for preparation. Meanwhile, the guest waits for their food to be ready.

Once the food is ready, the restaurant staff brings the food to the guest and they begin to eat. After enjoying their meal, the guest decides to leave the restaurant and issue a guest complaint.

The complaint is then processed by the restaurant staff, who inform the employees about the issue. The restaurant staff then retrieves the guest's order and prepares it for pickup.

In the meantime, the court issues a court order, which is then communicated to the restaurant staff. The staff informs the employees about the court order and the process continues.

The guest's order is eventually retrieved and the staff prepares it for pickup. The guest leaves the restaurant and the process ends with the staff informing the employees about the guest's issue.

Throughout this process, various events and gateways are triggered, such as the guest feeling hungry, ordering food, the food being ready, and the guest leaving the restaurant. The process is also connected to the court order, which affects the restaurant staff's actions.

In summary, the guest's experience at the restaurant involves selecting a dish, waiting for the food to be prepared, eating, and leaving with a complaint. The restaurant staff handles the order, prepares the food, and communicates with employees about the guest's issue. The process is also influenced by a court order, which affects the staff's actions.
