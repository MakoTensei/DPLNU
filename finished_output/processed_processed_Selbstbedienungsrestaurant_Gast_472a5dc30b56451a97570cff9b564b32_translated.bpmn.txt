 A guest arrives at the restaurant and requests to order a pie. The restaurant processes the order and sends a notification to the Court of Justice. The Court of Justice then informs a guest at the series about the order. The guest at the series picks up the order and accepts it. The pie is prepared and ready, so the kitchen informs the employees. Meanwhile, the guest at the series meets with the food ready, and the process concludes with the guest enjoying their meal.

Here's the flow described in a more natural description:

1. A guest arrives at the restaurant and places an order for a pie.
2. The restaurant processes the order and notifies the Court of Justice.
3. The Court of Justice informs a guest at the series about the pie order.
4. The guest at the series picks up the pie order and accepts it.
5. The kitchen prepares the pie and informs the employees that it's ready.
6. The guest at the series meets with the food ready and enjoys their meal.
