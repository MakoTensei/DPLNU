 In the world of scoring, a series of events and gateways work together to ensure that scores are shared and reported accurately. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Share delay' task. This task is responsible for initiating the sharing of the scoring process.

Once the 'Share delay' task is completed, the 'EventBasedGateway1' comes into play. This gateway receives the 'StartEvent0' and directs the process to the 'EndEvent0'. At the same time, it also sends the 'StartEvent0' to the 'Scoring available' task, which is responsible for determining if the scoring process is ready to proceed.

The 'Scoring available' task, upon receiving the 'Score available?' signal, sends the 'Score available?' message to the 'Score available?' gateway. This gateway then directs the process to the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3'.

Meanwhile, the 'Share scoring' task, which was initiated by the 'Share delay' task, receives the 'Score available?' signal from the 'Score available?' gateway. This task then shares the scoring process by sending the 'Share scoring' message to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Scoring Level 1' task, which was triggered by the 'StartEvent1', receives the 'Score available?' signal from the 'Score available?' gateway. This task then checks if the scoring process is available and sends the 'Score available?' message to the 'Scoring Level 2' task.

The 'Scoring Level 2' task, upon receiving the 'Score available?' signal, shares the scoring process by sending the 'Share scoring' message to the 'EndEvent2'.

Finally, the 'Share scoring' task, which was initiated by the 'Share delay' task, receives the 'Score available?' signal from the 'Scoring Level 2' task. This task then shares the scoring process by sending the 'Share scoring' message to the 'EndEvent3'.

In summary, the scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Share delay' task. This task initiates the sharing of the scoring process and sends the 'Score available?' signal to the 'Scoring available' task. The
