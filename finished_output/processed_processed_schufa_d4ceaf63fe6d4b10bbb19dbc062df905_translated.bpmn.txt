 When a scoring request is obtained from Sufa, the system initiates a process to calculate the final scoring. This process starts with the 'Scoring immediately available?' gateway, which checks if the scoring data is ready. Upon confirmation, the request is forwarded to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then triggers the 'Calculate final scoring' task. This task, upon completion, generates the'scoring values\nReport' and sends it back through 'ExclusiveGateway1' to the 'EventBasedGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'Delay message\nobtained' event is also processed by 'EventBasedGateway3', which then sends the message to the'sid-16D53F27-0F5B-4B22-B7AE-28225DA75D28' destination. This entire sequence ensures that the scoring request is handled efficiently and the final report is generated and delivered.
