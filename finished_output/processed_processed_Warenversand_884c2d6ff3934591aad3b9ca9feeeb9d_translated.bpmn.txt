 In the logistics process, there are several tasks and gateways involved in handling goods ready for dispatch. The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' start event, which triggers the following sequence:

1. The goods are first directed to the 'Special shipment?' gateway, which checks if the shipment requires special handling.
2. If the shipment is not special, it proceeds to the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway, where the 'Standardised parcel certificate filling' task is performed.
3. The goods then move to the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway, where the 'Select offers' task is executed.
4. The 'Specialist' task is triggered at the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway, which handles specialized services for the shipment.
5. The 'Pick up offers' task is executed at the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway, where offers for picking up the goods are presented.
6. The 'Spediteur 1', 'Spediteur 2', and 'Spediteur 3' tasks are performed at the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway, where different shipping options are offered.
7. The 'Packaging goods' task is executed at the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway, where the goods are prepared for collection.
8. The 'Complete insurance' task is performed at the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway, where insurance is finalized for the shipment.
9. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is executed at the 'ParallelGateway4' gateway, where the goods are ready for collection.

The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event, which signifies the completion of the logistics process.
