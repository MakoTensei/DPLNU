 The process begins with the 'Start Schufascroing Bank' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to handle the incoming task. This gateway then leads to the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which is initiated by the 'StartEvent1' event. Upon successful completion of Level 1 scoring, the 'Level 1 successful' event is triggered. Following this, the 'Scoring Level2' task is performed, which is initiated by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task. This task leads to the 'EndEvent2' event, marking the completion of the process.
