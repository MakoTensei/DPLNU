 In the shipping process, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Insurance close' task, involving the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is responsible for closing insurance and has 'ExclusiveGateway2' as its incoming gateway. Following this, the 'Check shipment quantity' task is initiated, which involves 'ParallelGateway3' and leads to the 'Select the freight forwarder and assign transport order' task, which in turn connects back to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Offers for shipping' task, also connected to 'ParallelGateway3', proceeds to the 'Select the freight forwarder and assign transport order' task. After this, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered, which requires an 'Insurance required?' decision. This decision is made at 'Exclusic

Subsequently, the 'Packaging goods' task, which relies on 'ParallelGateway4', is followed by the 'Supplying goods for shipping' task, which concludes the process at 'EndEvent0'.

Here's a more natural flow description:

1. The shipping process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Insurance close' task. This task involves 'ExclusiveGateway0', which is responsible for finalizing insurance coverage.

2. The 'Insurance close' task then leads to the 'Check shipment quantity' task, which requires the 'ParallelGateway3'. This task ensures the correct quantity of goods is available for shipping.

3. The 'Check shipment quantity' task connects to the 'Select the freight forwarder and assign transport order' task, which is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task involves choosing the appropriate freight forwarder and assigning a transport order.

4. The 'Offers for shipping' task, which also relies on 'ParallelGateway3', leads to the 'Select
