 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Processing' task, leading to the 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway then connects to the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which in turn results in the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' connects to the 'Result?' gateway, which has two incoming connections: 'StartEvent0' and 'Score'. The 'Score' task is linked to the 'ParallelGateway2', which also connects to the 'Level 2 scoring' task. This task finally leads to the 'Score' event, which is the final output of the process.
