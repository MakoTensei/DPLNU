 When a customer experiences hunger, they enter the restaurant and are prompted to select a court, which is the starting event. This action leads to the 'Add your order' task, where the customer can place their order. Once the order is placed, the 'Pieper sounds' event is triggered, indicating that the order is ready to be picked up.

The customer then proceeds to pick up their food, which is the 'Pick up food' task. After receiving the food, the 'Food ready' event is triggered, signaling that the meal is prepared and ready to be served.

The 'Food ready' event initiates the 'Pieper\ntrigger' task, which is responsible for informing the restaurant staff that the meal is ready for serving. The staff then serves the meal to the customer, and the 'Eating through' task is triggered, indicating that the customer is enjoying their meal.

Once the customer finishes eating, the 'inform employees' task is triggered, notifying the staff that the meal is finished. Finally, the 'Meals\nfinished' event is triggered, marking the end of the meal service.

In summary, the flow of events in the restaurant process is as follows:

1. Customer experiences hunger and enters the restaurant.
2. Customer selects a court to place their order.
3. Customer places their order.
4. Customer picks up their food.

6. Staff is informed that the meal is ready for serving.
7. Customer eats the meal.
8. Staff is informed that the meal is finished.
