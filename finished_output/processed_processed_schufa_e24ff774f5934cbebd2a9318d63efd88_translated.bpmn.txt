 In the financial services ecosystem, a series of events and gateways work together to process and share credit scores. When a Schufa Score request is initiated, it triggers the Level1 Score determination process. This process, identified by the unique ID'sid-C3995A4C-984C-4DBF-BC45-AAB4BE3E614D', receives the Schufa Score request and forwards it to two exclusive gateways: 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent0'.

Once the Level1 Score is determined, it is then passed to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn sends the score to 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, the Level1 Score is also sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for sharing the delay notice with 'Schufa Send inquiry result'.

Meanwhile, the Schufa Score request also triggers the 'Receive Level1 Score' event, which forwards the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway is responsible for handling the delay message, which is received from 'EventBasedGateway4'.

The Level1 Score is then used to determine the Level2 Score, which is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway, in turn, sends the Level2 Score to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process begins with a Schufa Score request, which triggers the Level1 Score determination process. The determined score is then shared with 'EndEvent0' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The delay message is handled by 'ExclusiveGateway3', and the Level2 Score is determined and sent to 'EndEvent0' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
