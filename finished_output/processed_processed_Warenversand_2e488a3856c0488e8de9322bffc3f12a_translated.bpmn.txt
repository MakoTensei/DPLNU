 The process begins with the 'Product ordered' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' to handle the incoming order. This gateway then routes the order to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which is responsible for the 'Packaging of goods' task. The 'Packaging of goods' is then completed by the 'ParallelGateway6', which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' for further processing.

Simultaneously, the 'Product ordered' event also sends the order to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn routes the order to the 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'ParallelGateway3' is responsible for the 'Secretariat clears shipping' task, which is then followed by the 'Offer Sped 1\n', 'Special offer Sped2', and 'Special offer Sped 3' tasks.

Meanwhile, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' also sends the order to the 'Selection' task, which is handled by the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' then routes the order to the 'Border Spediteur' for customs clearance.

On the other hand, the 'Goods are provided by LAgerarbeiter' event triggers the 'EndEvent0' task, which signifies the completion of the process.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:
1. 'Product ordered' event triggers 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
2. 'ParallelGateway5' routes the order to 'Packaging of goods' task at 'ParallelGateway6'.
3. 'ExclusiveGateway0' routes the order to 'Secretariat clears shipping' task at 'ParallelGateway3', followed by 'Offer Sped 1\n', 'Special offer Sped2', and 'Special offer Sped 3' tasks.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway0' also routes the order to 'Selection' task at 'ParallelGateway4'.
5. 'ParallelGateway4' routes the order to 'Border Spediteur' for customs clearance.
