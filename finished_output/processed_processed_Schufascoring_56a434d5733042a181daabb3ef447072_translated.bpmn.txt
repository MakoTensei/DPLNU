 Upon receiving a "Scoring request obtained" event, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the scoring request and generate a score. Here's a natural flow of the described process:

1. The system receives a "Scoring request obtained" event, triggering the addition of a message to the workflow.

2. The message is sent to ExclusiveGateway0, where the "Result level 1 obtained" event is processed.

3. ExclusiveGateway0 sends a "Message Score send" event to the next step in the workflow.

4. The "Message Score send" event is received by ExclusiveGateway0, which then sends a "Level 2 message sent" event to the next step.

5. The "Level 2 message sent" event is received by ParallelGateway3, which sends a "Message send" event to the next step.

6. The "Message send" event is received by ParallelGateway3, which sends a "Level 2 message sent" event to the next step.

7. The "Level 2 message sent" event is received by ExclusiveGateway2, which sends a "Message" event to the next step.

8. The "Message" event is received by ExclusiveGateway1, which sends a "Message Scoring result production" event to the next step.

9. The "Message Scoring result production" event is received by ExclusiveGateway0, which sends a "Message Scoring result production" event to the next step.

10. The "Message Scoring result production" event is received by ExclusiveGateway2, which sends a "Message" event to the next step.

11. The "Message" event is received by ExclusiveGateway1, which sends a "Message" event to the next step.

12. The "Message" event is received by ExclusiveGateway0, which sends a "Message Create a score" event to the next step.

13. The "Message Create a score" event is received by ExclusiveGateway0, which sends a "Message Create a score" event to the next step.
