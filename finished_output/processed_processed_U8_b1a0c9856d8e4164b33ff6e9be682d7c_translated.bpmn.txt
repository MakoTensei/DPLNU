 A customer feeling hungry decides to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they select their desired meal, which is then added to their cart. The customer proceeds to the checkout, where they pay for their order. After receiving the payment, the restaurant staff prepares the meal and informs the kitchen about the order.

Once the meal is ready, the kitchen staff places it in the reach for the chef. The chef then takes over and prepares the meal. After the meal is prepared, the kitchen staff informs the front-of-house staff about the completion of the meal.

The front-of-house staff then picks up the meal and serves it to the customer. The customer enjoys their meal and is satisfied with the service.

The restaurant's event-driven system ensures a smooth and efficient process from the customer's hunger to the enjoyment of their meal. The system's gateways and events facilitate communication and coordination between different departments, ensuring a seamless dining experience for the customer.
