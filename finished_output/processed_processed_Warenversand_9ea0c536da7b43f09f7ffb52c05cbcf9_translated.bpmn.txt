 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0', leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. From there, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the order to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' for 'Specify the shipping method' and 'Complete insurance'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the order to the 'ParallelGateway3' for 'Examination Order Size'. The 'Examination Order Size' task is then sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' again, which in turn sends the order to the 'ParallelGateway4' for 'Packaging goods'. The 'Packaging goods' task is then sent to the 'ParallelGateway4' again, which finally sends the order to the 'EndEvent0'.
