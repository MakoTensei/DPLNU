 When the "StartEvent0" initiates, it triggers a "Scoring request obtained" event, which then sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway0". This gateway, upon receiving the request, processes it and sends a "Scoring Level 1\nperform" task to be executed. Once the task is completed, "ExclusiveGateway0" sends a "Scoring result obtained" message to "Scoring result\nobtained", which in turn sends a "Delay message obtained" to "Delay message\nobtained". The "EndEvent0" concludes the process by receiving the "Delay message obtained" and "Scoring result obtained" messages. Meanwhile, "EndEvent1" marks the completion of the scoring process by receiving the "Scoring result obtained" message.
