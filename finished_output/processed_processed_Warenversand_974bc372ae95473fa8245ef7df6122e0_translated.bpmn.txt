 The process begins with the 'Shipping necessary' task, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the shipping process. This gateway also connects to the 'Filling the package note' task, ensuring that the necessary packaging details are filled. Concurrently, the 'Insurance necessary?' task is initiated, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5' for insurance processing.

Once the shipping and insurance processes are complete, the 'ParallelGateway4' is responsible for checking the goods dispatch. If the goods are of large quantities, the process diverts to the 'Large quantities?' task, which connects to the'sid-C449511C-6CB9-4720-A5C6-14ECDAE59A3D' and 'Filling the package note' tasks.

After the goods dispatch check, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' for further processing. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is triggered, leading to the 'EndEvent0' to conclude the process.
