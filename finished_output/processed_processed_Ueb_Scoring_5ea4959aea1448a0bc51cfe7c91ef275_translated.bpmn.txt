 In this system, we have a series of tasks and gateways that work together to process scoring requests and forward results. The process begins with a StartEvent0, which triggers a sequence of events and interactions between different components.

1. StartEvent0 initiates the process by sending a message to EventBasedGateway1. This gateway receives the message and forwards it to two tasks: 'forward scoring level 2' and 'Scoring request'.

2. The 'forward scoring level 2' task receives the message from EventBasedGateway1 and sends a message to the 'Scoring request' task. This task then sends a 'Scoring request' message to Result? gateway.

3. Result? gateway receives the 'Scoring request' message and forwards it to two tasks: 'Scoring request' and 'Scoring request'.

4. The first 'Scoring request' task receives the message from Result? gateway and sends a 'Scoring request' message to the 'Scoring Level 1' task.

5. The 'Scoring Level 1' task receives the 'Scoring request' message and sends a 'Scoring result level 1 received' message to EventBasedGateway1.

6. EventBasedGateway1 receives the 'Scoring result level 1 received' message and forwards it to the 'Scoring request' task.

7. The 'Scoring request' task receives the 'Scoring result level 1 received' message and sends a 'Scoring request' message to the 'Scoring Level 2' task.

8. The 'Scoring Level 2' task receives the 'Scoring request' message and sends a 'Scoring result level 2 received' message to EventBasedGateway1.

9. EventBasedGateway1 receives the 'Scoring result level 2 received' message and forwards it to the 'Scoring request' task.

10. The 'Scoring request' task receives the 'Scoring result level 2 received' message and sends a 'Scoring request' message to the 'Scoring Level 2' task.

11. The '
