 When a shipping order is received, the process begins with checking the shipping mode, which involves coordinating with ParallelGateway4. Once the order is confirmed, the next step is to request quotes from three freight forwarders to find the cheapest option. Concurrently, a special delivery is initiated, which requires filling a standard package voucher and checking for insurance emergencies.

As the special delivery progresses, the freight forwarder is selected, and the order is routed to ExclusiveGateway3. Meanwhile, the insurance emergency check is also processed through ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway4 then handles the packaging of goods, which are subsequently ready for collection. The insurance emergency check is completed, and the goods are ready for collection, with the insurance being provided through ExclusiveGateway2.

In summary, the process starts with receiving a shipping order, checking the shipping mode, requesting quotes from freight forwarders, initiating special delivery, filling package vouchers, checking for insurance emergencies, packaging goods, and finally, preparing the goods for collection with insurance coverage.
