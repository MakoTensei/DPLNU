 In a system designed to handle scoring requests and reporting, the following processes are initiated and completed:

When a scoring request is received, it triggers the 'Scoring request' process, which then sends a message to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway, in turn, directs the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which marks the start of the scoring process.

As the scoring process begins, the 'StartEvent0' is triggered, and the 'EventBasedGateway2' sends the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends the request to the 'Scoring arrived' process, which completes the scoring and sends a message to the 'Returning result' process.

The 'Returning result' process, upon receiving the message, marks the end of the scoring process with 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring arrived' process also sends a message to the 'Delay' process, which delays the reporting back by sending a message to the 'Delay to report back' process.

The 'Delay to report back' process, upon receiving the message, marks the start of the delay period with 'StartEvent0'.

Once the delay period is over, the 'Delay' process sends a message to the 'Scoring arrived' process, which then sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to mark the end of the delay period with 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Send Scoring' process, triggered by the 'Results available' event, sends a message to the 'Scoring arrived' process, which then sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to mark the end of the scoring process with 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Results available' event also triggers the 'EndEvent1' process, which marks the end of the reporting process with 'EndEvent1'.

In summary, the system handles scoring requests by initiating the scoring process, delaying the reporting back, and finally reporting the results. The processes are interconnected through gateways and events, ensuring a smooth flow of information and actions.
