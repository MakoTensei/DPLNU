 In the process of handling a scoring inquiry, the following sequence of events and gateways are involved:

1. The process starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Send Scoringan inquiry' task. This task is responsible for initiating the scoring inquiry process.

2. The 'Send Scoringan inquiry' task sends an inquiry and is followed by 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', which captures the intermediate state of the inquiry.

3. The inquiry then proceeds to 'StartEvent1', which triggers the 'Scoring (level 1)' task. This task is responsible for the initial level of scoring.

4. The 'Scoring (level 1)' task completes and sends a result, which is captured by 'Result (L1) transferred' task. This task transfers the result to the next stage.

5. The 'Result (L1) transferred' task is followed by 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which captures the intermediate state of the result transfer.

6. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is responsible for deciding the next course of action based on the result.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task sends the result to 'EndEvent1', which marks the completion of the scoring inquiry process.

8. The 'EndEvent1' task triggers the 'Result (L2) transfer' task, which transfers the result to the next level of scoring.

9. The 'Result (L2) transfer' task is followed by 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' again, which captures the intermediate state of the result transfer.

10. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task sends the result to 'EventBasedGateway2', which is responsible for handling the result based on the event.

11. The 'EventBasedGateway2' task sends the result to 'EndEvent0', which marks the completion of the scoring inquiry process at level 2.

In summary, the scoring inquiry process starts with 'StartEvent0', goes through multiple tasks and gateways, and ends with 'EndEvent1'. The process involves sending inquiries, scoring at different
