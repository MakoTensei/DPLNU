 In the logistics process, there are several tasks and gateways involved in handling orders and forwarding offers. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the following tasks:

1. 'Send mail to order - Fill in parcel form' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0' and is responsible for picking up forwarding offers.
2. 'Pick up forwarding offers' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and is responsible for spediteur 1.
3. 'Spediteur 1' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and is responsible for task5.
4. 'Insurance close' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and is responsible for goods.
5. 'Goods' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and is responsible for order ready for shipping.
6. 'Order ready for shipping' is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4' and is responsible for postal mail.

The 'EndEvent0' is triggered when the postal mail is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

In summary, the logistics process starts with the 'StartEvent0' and involves several tasks and gateways to handle orders and forwarding offers. The process ends with the 'EndEvent0' when the postal mail is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.
