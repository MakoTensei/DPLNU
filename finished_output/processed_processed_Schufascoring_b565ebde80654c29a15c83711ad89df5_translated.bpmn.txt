 When a "Schufascoring desired" event is triggered, it initiates a scoring process. The event "Scoring request obtained" is then received, which prompts the "fast Result?" gateway to provide a quick response. Upon obtaining the result, the "Scoring request" task is completed, and the "fast Result available" gateway delivers the outcome. Subsequently, the "Conduct scoring Level 1" task is executed, leading to the "fast Result?" gateway receiving the obtained score and forwarding it to the "Grapes Level 2 achieved" task. This task signifies the successful completion of Level 2 scoring, with the final outcome being communicated through the "Grapes Level 2 achieved" event.
