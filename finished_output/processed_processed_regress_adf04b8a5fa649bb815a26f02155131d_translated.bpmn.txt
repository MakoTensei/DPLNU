 When a notification of possible regression is received, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. The first task, identified by the ID'sid-4E98C777-5C9B-4A40-9378-127C181072A9', is to check the regression case. This task is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3' upon completion.

If the notification of possible regression is also received by 'EventBasedGateway4', it triggers two tasks. The first task, with the ID'sid-7E227327-3A47-4017-AFDE-3F0B293D44E4', sends a payment request to Vietnam (VN), and the second task, with the ID'sid-7B529348-DE5B-49B1-9CDC-9F6AF03281F6', donates to the debtor. Both tasks are directed to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In the case of 'ParallelGateway5' receiving the notification of possible regression, the task to book the entrance is initiated, identified by the ID'sid-34EC88EC-2DF6-4509-80DB-5C4D37C86B84'. This task is directed to 'Close' upon completion.

If 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives a contradiction from Vietnam, the task to set on re-submission is initiated, identified by the ID'sid-60B393CC-BD5D-4A5B-B5DF-04B60D5BB343'. This task is directed to 'VN contradicts'.

Upon receiving a contradiction from Vietnam, the task to close the case is initiated, identified by the ID'sid-0EFB800F-B7D2-4084-BA28-9AA22C1F1462'. This task is directed to 'Case closed'.

If 'EventBasedGateway4' receives a notification of possible regression,
