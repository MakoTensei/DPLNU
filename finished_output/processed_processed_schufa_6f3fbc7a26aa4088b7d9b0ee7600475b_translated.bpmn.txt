 In the scoring process, the system starts with the 'Schufascoring\nQuestions' event, which triggers the 'perform scoring' task. This task is responsible for scoring the questions and is connected to the 'Schufascore\ndetermined' event, which signifies the completion of the scoring. The 'Schufascore\ndetermined' event then connects to the 'EndEvent0' event, which marks the end of the scoring phase.

Simultaneously, the 'Schufascoring\n' event initiates the 'Report the result' task, which is responsible for reporting the final score. This task is connected to the 'EndEvent1' event, which signifies the completion of the reporting phase.

The 'perform scoring' task is also connected to the 'Schufascore delay' task, which introduces a delay before the score is determined. This delay task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' event, which further connects to the 'EndEvent0' event.

The 'Level 2 - Scoring\nperform' task, which is responsible for the second level of scoring, is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway3' event. This task is also connected to the 'EndEvent1' event, which signifies the completion of the second level of scoring.

In summary, the scoring process involves multiple tasks and events, including 'perform scoring', 'Schufascore delay', 'Schufascore\ndetermined', 'Report the result', and 'Level 2 - Scoring\nperform'. These tasks and events are interconnected through various gateways and end events, ensuring a smooth and efficient scoring process.
