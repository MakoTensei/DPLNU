 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the scoring results task, which is triggered when the 'Result immediately available?' event is received from the 'Scoring Result Available?' gateway. This event is then passed to the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway, which in turn sends the 'Send scoring results' task to the'sid-E60A3279-016F-4B2F-A963-D586F07864B4' gateway. The 'Send scoring results' task is then completed when the 'EndEvent0' event is received, signaling the end of the process.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' event triggers the 'EventBasedGateway2' event, which then passes the 'Result immediately available?' event to the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway. This event is then sent to the'sid-8BEC34DD-41C0-4D27-8CAA-8CCA66ABEEFF' task, which sends the 'Send scoring results' task to the'sid-E60A3279-016F-4B2F-A963-D586F07864B4' gateway. The 'Send scoring results' task is completed when the 'EndEvent1' event is received, signaling the end of the process.

In summary, the scoring results task is triggered by the 'Result immediately available?' event and completed when the 'EndEvent0' or 'EndEvent1' event is received. The process is parallelized using the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway, which sends the 'Send scoring results' task to the'sid-E60A3279-016F-4B2F-A963-D586F07864B4' gateway.
