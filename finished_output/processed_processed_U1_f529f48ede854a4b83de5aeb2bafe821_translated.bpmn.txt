 When a product is ordered, the process begins with a 'Request a quote' event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. This task checks if insurance is necessary, and if so, it proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' where the 'Insurance necessary?' event is received. If insurance is required, the process moves to the 'Delivering goods' task, which also checks for insurance necessity and sends the 'Insurance necessary?' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.


For a 'Big shipment' scenario, the process starts with the 'Product is ordered' event, leading to the 'Request a quote' task. The 'Big shipment?' event is then received at the 'Big shipment?\n' gateway, which determines if insurance is needed. If insurance is necessary, the process flows to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' where the 'Insurance necessary?' event is received. The process then continues to the 'Specialist' task, which also checks for insurance and sends the 'Insurance necessary?' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.


After the 'Specialist' task, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered, which also checks for insurance and sends the 'Insurance necessary?' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Explain insurance' task follows, which receives the 'Big shipment?' event and sends the 'Insurance necessary?' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Complete insurance' task is then executed, which checks for insurance and sends the 'EndEvent0' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.


Finally, the 'EndEvent0' is the concluding event for all tasks, and it is triggered by the 'Complete insurance' task for both 'Packaging goods' and 'Delivering goods' tasks, as well as the 'Specialist' task.
