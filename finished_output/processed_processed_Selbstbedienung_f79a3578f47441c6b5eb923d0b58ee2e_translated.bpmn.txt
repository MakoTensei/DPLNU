 In this food ordering system, the process begins with a new first customer entering the snake, triggering a series of events and interactions between different tasks and gateways. Here's a descriptive flow of the process:

1. A new first customer enters the snake, initiating the process with the 'new first customer in the snake' start event. This event triggers the 'Deliver food' task, which sends a request for money to the customer.

2. The customer accepts the money request, and the 'Request money' task is completed.

3. The 'Adjust Pieper' task is triggered, instructing the guest instructor to pass the Pieper to the guest.

4. The 'Guest instruct pass and tell Pieper to guest' task is completed, and the 'Koch inform' task is triggered, informing Koch about the food readiness.

5. The 'Food ready' start event is triggered, and the 'Pieper insert' task is completed, indicating that the food is ready.

6. The 'Food ready' gateway is triggered, and the 'Customer appears on the issue' task is completed, with the customer now appearing on the issue.

7. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway is triggered, and the 'Deliver food' and 'Customer appears on the issue' tasks are completed, with the food being delivered to the customer and the customer appearing on the issue.

8. The '5 minutes' gateway is triggered, and the 'Order completed' task is completed after the customer has been served for 5 minutes.

9. The 'Food ready' gateway is triggered again, and the 'Get food' task is completed, with the customer receiving the food.

10. The 'Get food' gateway is triggered, and the 'Sat' task is completed, indicating that the customer has finished eating and is satisfied.

This flow ensures a smooth and efficient process for the new first customer to place an order, receive the food, and enjoy their meal.
