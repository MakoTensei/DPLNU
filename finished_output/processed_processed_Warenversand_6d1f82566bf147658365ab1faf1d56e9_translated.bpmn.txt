 The process begins with a 'Date triggered' event, which initiates a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways.

1. The 'Date triggered' event sends a signal to 'Special offers' gateway, which in turn connects to 'Specialist' gateway. The 'Specialist' gateway then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

2. Concurrently, the 'Date triggered' event also connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which sends a signal to 'Pick up offers' gateway. This gateway connects to 'Specialist' gateway, which again connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

3. The 'Specialist' gateway also receives a signal from 'ParallelGateway4', which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

4. 'ExclusiveGateway1' connects to 'ParallelGateway7', which is responsible for providing goods for collection.

5. 'ParallelGateway5' connects to 'ParallelGateway7', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

6. 'ParallelGateway4' connects to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for checking the shipment.

7. 'ParallelGateway6' connects to 'ParallelGateway7', which is responsible for providing goods for collection.

8. 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for checking the shipment.

9. 'ParallelGateway6' connects to 'Process carried out' gateway, which signifies the completion of the process.

In summary, the 'Date triggered' event initiates a chain of tasks and interactions between various gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Process carried out' event. The process involves checking shipments, filling package notes, picking up offers, providing insurance, packaging goods, and ensuring exclusive delivery.
