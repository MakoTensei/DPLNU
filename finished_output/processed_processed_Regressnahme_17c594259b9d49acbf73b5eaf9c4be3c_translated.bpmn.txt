 In the workflow, the process begins with the 'Regression report' event, which triggers the 'Payment on Send request' task. This task is dependent on the 'Check regression' task and leads to the 'Set process for resubmission' task. The 'Set process for resubmission' task, in turn, triggers the 'Payment' task.

The 'Payment' task is dependent on the 'Set process for resubmission' task and leads to the 'EventBasedGateway5' task. The 'EventBasedGateway5' task is dependent on the 'Payment' task and the 'Reimbursement period expired' event, and it results in the 'Finished' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Regression report' event also triggers the 'Close' task, which is dependent on the 'Check regression' task and leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is dependent on the 'Check regression' task and the 'Close' task, and it results in the 'Finished' task.

Additionally, the 'Reimbursement period expired' event triggers the 'Close' task, which is dependent on the 'Reimbursement period expired' event and leads to the 'EventBasedGateway5' task.

Lastly, the 'Manufactured' event triggers the 'Transfer to the debt collection' task, which is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway4' task and leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway4' task and the 'Manufactured' event, and it results in the 'Finished' task.

In summary, the workflow involves various tasks and gateways that are interconnected, with specific dependencies and outcomes. The 'Regression report' event initiates the process, leading to multiple tasks and gateways, ultimately resulting in the 'Finished' task.
