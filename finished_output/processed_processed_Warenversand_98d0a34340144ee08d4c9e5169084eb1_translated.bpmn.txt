 The process begins with the 'Start Shipment' event, which triggers the 'Order clarification (large/small)' task. This task is then routed to 'ParallelGateway4', which subsequently leads to the 'Filling the package note' task. The 'Filling the package note' task requires the 'Insurance?' task to be completed, which is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway4' also leads to the 'Pick up offers' task, which is then routed to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' task triggers the 'Special offer' task twice, which are then routed to 'ParallelGateway6'.

The 'Goods ready for collection' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway6', which is then routed to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. 'Start Shipment' event triggers 'Order clarification (large/small)' task, which is routed to 'ParallelGateway4'.
2. 'ParallelGateway4' routes 'Filling the package note' task, which requires 'Insurance?' task.
3. 'Insurance?' task is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
4. 'ParallelGateway4' also routes 'Pick up offers' task, which triggers 'Special offer' task twice.
2. 'Special offer' tasks are routed to 'ParallelGateway6'.
3. 'ParallelGateway6' triggers 'Goods ready for collection' task, which is routed to 'EndEvent0'.

This process ensures that all tasks are completed in the correct order and that the necessary information is passed between tasks and gateways.
