 When the event 'Goods are to be sent' occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to ensure the efficient handling of the shipment. First, it checks with 'ParallelGateway4' to determine if a message needs to be sent, which leads to the 'Send a message' task. Concurrently, the system also queries 'ParallelGateway3' to ascertain if a special shipment is necessary, resulting in the 'Is special shipment necessary?' task. If the special shipment is required, the system engages the 'Specialist' to handle the unique needs of the shipment.

Simultaneously, the system also checks with 'ParallelGateway5' to determine if the goods need to be packaged, leading to the 'Product is packaged' task. If the goods are to be packaged, the system proceeds to the 'Complete insurance' task to ensure the shipment is adequately covered.

The 'Specialist' task is connected to the 'Is special shipment necessary?' task, and the 'Complete insurance' task is linked to the 'Insurance necessary?' task. Additionally, the 'ParallelGateway5' task is connected to both the 'Send a message' and 'Complete insurance' tasks.

Upon completion of these tasks, the system concludes with the 'Shipping by mail' event, where the goods are dispatched for delivery. This event is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway4' task and signifies the successful completion of the shipment process.
