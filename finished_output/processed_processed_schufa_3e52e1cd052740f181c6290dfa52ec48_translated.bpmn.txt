 In the event of a StartEvent1, the system initiates Level 1 scoring, which is determined by the incoming event 'StartEvent1'. This process leads to a decision point where Level 2 scoring is evaluated, and if necessary, the system transitions to Level 2 scoring through the gateway 'Level 2 scoring necessary?' with the incoming event 'StartEvent1'. Upon completion of Level 2 scoring, the system sends the result through the gateway 'Send result', which is connected to 'Level 2 scoring necessary?' with the incoming event 'StartEvent1'. The result is then forwarded to the ExclusiveGateway0, which is connected to 'EventBasedGateway2' and 'Results obtained'. 'EventBasedGateway2' receives the result and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn triggers 'EndEvent0'. This marks the completion of the process.
