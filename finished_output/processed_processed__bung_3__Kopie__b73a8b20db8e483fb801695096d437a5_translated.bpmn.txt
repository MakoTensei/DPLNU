 When a regression report arrives, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure the proper handling of the report. First, the report is sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which then decides whether a regression is possible. If a regression is deemed necessary, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway1 and ExclusiveGateway3.

If a regression is not required, the report is sent to BookPaymentReceipt, which records the incoming payment and sends it to ExclusiveGateway1. In the case of a default period expiration or a contradiction with the VN, the report is directed to ExclusiveGateway1 as well.

Meanwhile, if the regression report justifies opposition, the process moves to the Debt Collection Office, which sends the report to ExclusiveGateway1.

Once the process reaches ExclusiveGateway3, it can either proceed to Close the Process if the opposition is justified or return to ExclusiveGateway1 if a regression is necessary.

In the end, regardless of the path taken, the process concludes at EndEvent0, which marks the completion of the process.
