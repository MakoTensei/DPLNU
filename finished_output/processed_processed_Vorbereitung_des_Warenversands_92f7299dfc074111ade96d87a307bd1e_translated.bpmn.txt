 The process begins with the event 'Shipping costs', which triggers the task 'Fill out standard package tickets' through the gateway 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is followed by 'Get three offers from Spedition', which requires 'Quantity' as an input and leads to 'Select a quote' through 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The selected quote then connects to the 'Specialist' through 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn requires 'Quantity' as input and leads to 'Check insurance requirements' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The insurance requirements are checked through 'Insurance necessary?' at 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Next, the goods are packaged through 'Packaging goods' at 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to 'Delivering goods' at 'ParallelGateway5'. The delivery process requires 'Quantity' as input and leads to 'Shipping costs\nFinished' through 'ParallelGateway5'. This marks the end of the process.
