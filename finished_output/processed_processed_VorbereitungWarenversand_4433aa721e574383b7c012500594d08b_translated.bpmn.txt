 In the process of shipping goods, the journey begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the packaging of goods. The packaged goods are then sent to 'ParallelGateway5' for further processing. At this point, the system evaluates whether a large shipping quantity is required. If so, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway3' to determine the shipping mode and fill the package note. Concurrently, if insurance is needed, the process diverges to 'ExclusiveGateway0' to handle the insurance requirements.


Once the shipping mode is determined and the package is filled, the goods are ready for collection. The system then sends a request to 'Spediteur 1' for a quote. Depending on the shipping quantity, a request is made to 'Spediteur 2' or 'Spediteur 3' for a more suitable offer. After receiving all offers, the best one is selected, and the 'Specialist' is engaged.


The 'Specialist' completes the packaging process and sends the goods for collection. If insurance is required, the process concludes with the completion of insurance. The entire process is finalized with 'EndEvent0', marking the successful completion of the shipping process.
