 When goods are received for shipping, the process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers the 'Provision for collection' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to 'Packing goods for shipping'. Once the goods are packed, the 'Decision on shipping type' task is initiated, which also connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. Based on this decision, the process diverges into two paths: one leads to 'InclusiveGateway2', which subsequently triggers 'Filling the package note' and 'Close insurance if necessary' tasks, while the other path leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Filling the package note' task then connects to 'ParallelGateway3', and the 'Close insurance if necessary' task also connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. After these tasks, the 'Provision for collection' task is triggered, which connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. This marks the end of the process, with the goods being prepared for collection.
