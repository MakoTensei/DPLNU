 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Fill standard package voucher' task, which in turn requires the 'Specify quantity' task to be completed. The 'Special delivery' task then initiates the 'Determining the insurance requirement' task, which leads to the 'Request three forwarders' task. This task adds three forwarders to the cart, and the 'Special delivery' task continues to the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task then sends the package to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which determines the insurance requirement and sends the package to the 'ParallelGateway5' task. The 'ParallelGateway5' task then sends the package to the 'Shipment' task, which sends the package to the 'EndEvent0' task. The 'EndEvent0' task then sends the package to the 'ParallelGateway4' task, which sends the package to the 'Insurance requirements\nNot applicable' task. Finally, the 'Insurance requirements\nNot applicable' task sends the package to the 'ParallelGateway5' task, which sends the package to the 'EndEvent0' task, completing the process.
