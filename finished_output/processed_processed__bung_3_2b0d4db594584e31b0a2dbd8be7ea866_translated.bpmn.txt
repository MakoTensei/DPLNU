 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check regression' task. This task checks for any regression issues and sends a notification to'sid-1F38D7EC-B5A7-4405-88C3-DAD653085E83'. If a regression is possible, the process moves to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which then sends a request to'sid-9BD8E310-5AAA-4CC5-98E5-28FC7A22B501' to send a payment request to Vietnam.

Simultaneously, the 'Regress possible?' gateway also sends a notification to'sid-CE1E6D01-430C-4F87-B339-76EB2FE64CF2' to record the process in 'dei Revolage'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' is then triggered, which sends a notification to'sid-FA16B059-708E-4087-BD1A-C786D5EF86B3' to book the payment receipt.

If the payment request to Vietnam is successful, the process proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' which then triggers the 'Proceedings' task. This task proceeds with the debt collection process and sends a notification to'sid-B39F6CC0-C166-4D2E-AF93-CFBE60BA23B5' to proceed with the collection.

If the payment request to Vietnam is not successful, the process goes back to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which then triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent6'. This event sends a notification to'sid-FA16B059-708E-4087-BD1A-C786D5EF86B3' to book the payment receipt again.

Once the payment receipt is booked, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' which then triggers the 'EndEvent0'. This event closes the process and sends notifications to'sid-
