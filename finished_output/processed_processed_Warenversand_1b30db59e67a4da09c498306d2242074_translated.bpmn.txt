 The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent' which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the packaging of goods. Once the goods are packaged, the 'ParallelGateway5' is responsible for providing the goods for collection. Following this, the 'Complete insurance' task is carried out, which requires 'Insurance\nRequired' as an incoming event. The insurance process is completed, and the 'Goods delivered' event is triggered, which is facilitated by 'Clearing the shipping mode'. The 'InclusiveGateway3' then takes over, handling the 'InclusiveGateway3' task, which involves filling in the parcel form for mail delivery. This task requires 'Insurance\nRequired' as an incoming event. The 'InclusiveGateway3' then sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway5' for delivery. The 'ParallelGateway5' then delivers the goods, completing the process.
