 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the packaging of goods, which then proceeds to the 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the goods are selected by a 'Specialist' who receives 'Pick up offers' and passes them to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Specialist' also receives 'Insurance?' from 'Insurance?', which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Specialist' then receives 'Lot?' from 'Lot?', which also goes to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ParallelGateway3' receives 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Lot?' from 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Lot?', respectively, and sends the goods for delivery. The 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' and requires 'Insurance?' from 'Insurance?', which also goes to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Finally, the 'Delivering goods' task is completed, and the process concludes with 'EndEvent0', which receives 'Specialist' and 'ParallelGateway3' from 'Specialist' and 'ParallelGateway3', respectively.
