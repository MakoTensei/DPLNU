 The process begins with the 'Shipping' event, which triggers the 'Delivering goods' task through ExclusiveGateway0. This task is followed by the 'Offers Pick up (3 spediteures)' task, which also goes through ExclusiveGateway0. After selecting an offer, the 'Select your offer' task is initiated, leading to ParallelGateway3. Specialists then step in through ParallelGateway3, and the 'Verification' task is triggered, which requires an 'Insurance necessary?' decision. If insurance is needed, the 'Complete insurance' task is executed, and the process continues through ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway3 also sends goods to ParallelGateway4, which in turn delivers the goods. Meanwhile, the 'Filling the package note' task is executed through ExclusiveGateway2, and the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated through ParallelGateway3. Finally, the 'Goods delivered' event is triggered, with the process concluding through ExclusiveGateway2 and ExclusiveGateway0.
