 In a system where tasks, gateways, start events, and end events interact, the following sequence of events and tasks can be described:

When the 'StartEvent0' occurs, it triggers the 'Follow-up' task, which sends a 'Delay ahead' message to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway then informs the 'Informing the front' task, which provides the 'Results provided' to the 'EndEvent2'.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Send delay' task, which sends a 'Send delay' message to 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway then triggers the 'Scoring' task, which sends a 'Scoring determined' message to the 'Answer in a short time?' gateway. This gateway then sends the 'Scoring determined' message to the 'Results provided' end event.

Additionally, the 'Send delay' task also sends a 'Scoring determined' message to the 'Follow-up' task, which then provides the 'Results provided' to the 'EndEvent2'.

In summary, the 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1' events initiate a series of tasks and gateways that ultimately lead to the 'Results provided' end event. The 'Delay ahead' and 'Send delay' tasks play a crucial role in informing the gateways and triggering the scoring process.
