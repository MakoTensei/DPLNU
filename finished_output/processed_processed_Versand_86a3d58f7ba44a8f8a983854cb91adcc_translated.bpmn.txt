 Upon receiving an order, the process begins with the 'Receive your order' start event, which triggers the 'Request offers' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to 'Adopt a proposal' task. The 'Adopt a proposal' task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This sequence of tasks and gateways continues with 'ParallelGateway5' receiving 'Insurance requirements' from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then leads to the 'EndEvent0' end event, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Throughout this process, other tasks such as 'Shipping', 'Package tickets', 'Expand and commission freight forwarders', 'Insurance requirements', 'Packaging goods', and 'Complete insurance' also play their respective roles in the overall workflow.
