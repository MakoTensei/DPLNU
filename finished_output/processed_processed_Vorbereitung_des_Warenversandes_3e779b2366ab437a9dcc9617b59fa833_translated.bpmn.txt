 Upon receiving an order, the process begins with the 'Collection of offers' task, which involves adding the order to the cart. This task is triggered by the 'Receive your order' event and has an outgoing connection to 'Add to Cart'. Once the order is in the cart, the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway receives the order and initiates the 'Check quantity' task to ensure the order quantity is correct. This task then connects to 'ParallelGateway6' for further processing.

If the order involves a 'Big crowd', the 'Specialist' task is triggered, which connects to 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Specialist' task is responsible for handling any special requirements or considerations for the order.

Simultaneously, the 'Check insurance requirements' task is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' event, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task ensures that the necessary insurance is in place for the order.

Once the insurance requirements are confirmed, the 'Insurance close' task is triggered, which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task finalizes the insurance process for the order.

After the insurance is confirmed, the 'Packaging goods' task is triggered, which connects to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task is responsible for packaging the order for shipment.

Finally, the 'Delivering goods' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway6' gateway, which connects to 'Shipping order completed'. This task ensures that the order is delivered to the customer.

In summary, the order process begins with the 'Collection of offers' task, which adds the order to the cart. The 'Check quantity' task ensures the order quantity is correct, and the 'Specialist' task handles any special requirements. The 'Check insurance requirements' task confirms the necessary insurance, and the 'Insurance close' task finalizes the insurance process. The 'Packaging goods' task packages the order for shipment, and the 'Delivering goods' task ensures the order is delivered to the customer.
