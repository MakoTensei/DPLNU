 In a system designed to handle scoring requests, the following processes and interactions occur:

1. A Scoring request is initiated by the 'Scorinag request' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway receives the request and forwards it to the 'Result Scoring' service.

2. The 'Result Scoring' service processes the request and sends a 'Result Scoring' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This event indicates that the scoring result is available.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the 'Result Scoring' event to the 'EndEvent0'.

4. Concurrently, the 'Scoring request\nSufa' event is triggered, which sends the request to the 'Scoring' service.

5. The 'Scoring' service processes the request and sends a 'Scoring' event to the 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent2'.

6. The 'Scoring result is available?' event is triggered, which sends the result to the 'EndEvent1' and 'EndEvent2'.

7. The 'Send deceleration probe' event is triggered by the 'Scorinag request', which sends a probe to the 'Send deceleration probe' service.

8. The 'Send deceleration probe' service processes the probe and sends a 'Send deceleration probe' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

9. The 'Scoring delays' event is triggered by the 'Scorinag request', which sends a delay information to the 'Scoring delays' service.

10. The 'Scoring delays' service processes the delay information and sends a 'Scoring delays' event to the 'EndEvent0'.

11. The 'Result\nScoring' event is triggered by the 'Scorinag request', which sends a result to the 'Result Scoring' service.

12. The 'Result Scoring' service processes the result and sends a 'Result Scoring' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

In summary, the system handles scoring requests by initiating a series of events
