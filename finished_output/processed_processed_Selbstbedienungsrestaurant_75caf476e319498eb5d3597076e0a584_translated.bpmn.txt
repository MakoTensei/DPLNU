 Let's describe the process of visiting a restaurant in a more natural flow:

1. You feel hungry, so you decide to visit a restaurant.
2. At the restaurant, you select a court (table or booth) to sit at.
3. Once you've chosen a seat, you place your order with the server.
4. The server takes your order and informs the kitchen staff.
5. The kitchen prepares your meal based on your order.
6. Your meal is ready and brought to your table.
7. After eating, you leave the restaurant.
