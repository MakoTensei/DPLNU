 The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'Order packaging' task. The 'Order packaging' task then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the goods are sent to 'ParallelGateway5' which is responsible for 'Pick up offers'. The 'Pick up offers' task sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4' again. Meanwhile, 'Offer 1' and 'Offer 2' tasks are triggered by 'ParallelGateway3' and send the offers to 'ParallelGateway2'. 'Offer 3' also goes through 'ParallelGateway3' and reaches 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'Filling the package note' task is initiated by 'Goods ready for dispatch' and sends the package to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Check preparation' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' and sends the goods to 'Shipment'. Finally, the 'Shipment' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway0' and completes the process.
