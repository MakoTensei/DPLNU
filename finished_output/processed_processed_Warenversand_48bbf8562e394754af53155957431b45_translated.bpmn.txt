 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scope of delivery determine' task, leading to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This task then connects to the 'Spediteur 1\nRequest a quote' task, which in turn links to the 'Selection' task. The 'Selection' task has connections to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' connects to the 'Packaging goods' task, which then leads to the 'Providing the goods' task, ending at 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Scope of delivery determine' task also connects to the 'Spediteur 2\nRequest a quote' task, which links to the 'Selection' task. The 'Selection' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Insurance\nnecessary?\n' task, triggered by 'StartEvent0', connects to the 'Completion of insurance' task, which then links to 'ParallelGateway7'. The 'ParallelGateway7' connects to the 'Fill in the parcel note' task, which leads to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Quantity?' task, triggered by 'StartEvent0', connects to both 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' connects to the 'EndEvent0', while the 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to 'ParallelGateway7'.

In summary, the process involves multiple tasks and gateways, with 'StartEvent0' initiating the process and 'EndEvent0' marking its completion. The tasks and gateways are interconnected, ensuring a smooth flow of operations.
