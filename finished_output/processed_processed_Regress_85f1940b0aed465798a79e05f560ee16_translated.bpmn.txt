 In the case management system, a series of tasks and gateways are interconnected to handle various events and outcomes. The process begins with the 'Regress reported' event, which triggers the 'VN payment request' task. This task is connected to the 'Regress Claim' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'VN payment request' and 'EndEvent2' outcomes.

Simultaneously, the 'all 5 days' event initiates the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, which eventually leads to the 'Case closing' outcome.

The 'Rejection' event triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task, which is connected to the 'EndEvent1' gateway. This gateway has two outcomes: 'Not justified' and 'Case closing'. The 'Not justified' outcome is connected to the'sid-EA390D1A-FD91-4055-9614-0464047F5565' task, which also leads to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Disclosure of debt collection' task is triggered by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' event and leads to the 'EndEvent1' outcome.

Lastly, the 'Case closing' tasks are initiated by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' events, both of which lead to the 'Case closing' outcome.

In summary, the case management system handles various events and outcomes through a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient process for managing cases.
