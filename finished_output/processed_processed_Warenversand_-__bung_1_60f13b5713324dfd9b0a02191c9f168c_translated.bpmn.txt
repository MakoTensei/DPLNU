 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Pick up three forwardings' task. This task then leads to the 'Select your offer' task, which in turn connects to the 'A lot big?' gateway. The 'A lot big?' gateway determines if the goods are large and sends the result to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task then connects back to the 'A lot big?' gateway, which sends the result to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task then leads to the 'Packaging goods' task.

Once the goods are packaged, the 'Packaging goods' task sends the result to the 'Goods ready for collection' task, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task then connects to the 'Check insurance requirements' task, which determines if insurance is necessary. If insurance is necessary, the 'Check insurance requirements' task sends the result to the 'Insurance close' task. The 'Insurance close' task then connects to the 'Goods ready for collection' task, which marks the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways that lead to the 'Goods ready for collection' event. The process involves packaging the goods, determining if insurance is necessary, and ultimately preparing the goods for collection.
