 Upon the arrival of a shipping order, the system initiates a series of tasks to process the order efficiently:

1. The system first determines the quantity required for the order, which is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is crucial for ensuring the correct amount of goods is prepared for shipment.

2. Concurrently, the system picks up the offers related to the shipping order. This is managed by the 'ParallelGateway5', which helps in identifying the best options for fulfilling the order.

3. To create a package ticket, the system needs to know the shipping size. This information is obtained from the 'Shipping size?' gateway, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The ticket creation process is essential for tracking and managing the package throughout its journey.

4. If insurance is required for the shipment, the system checks the shipping size and provides insurance details. The 'Insurance required?' gateway sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then connects to 'ParallelGateway8' to finalize the insurance details.

5. The system proceeds to packaging the goods for collection. This task is executed by 'ParallelGateway5', which ensures that the items are properly packed and ready for pickup.

6. To provide goods for collection, the system sends the package to 'ParallelGateway8', which is responsible for coordinating the collection process.

7. For creating a quote, the system receives the shipping order and sends it to 'ParallelGateway7'. This step is crucial for presenting the customer with a detailed quote for the shipping services.

8. Lastly, the system completes the insurance process by connecting to 'ParallelGateway8', which finalizes the insurance details and prepares the package for collection.

Throughout this process, the system ensures seamless communication between different gateways, enabling efficient order processing and delivery.
