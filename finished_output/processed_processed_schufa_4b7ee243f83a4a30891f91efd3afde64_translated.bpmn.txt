 In the realm of event-driven architecture, we have a series of gateways and events that orchestrate the flow of data and trigger specific actions. Let's dive into the details:

1. EventBasedGateway0: This gateway, identified by the ID'sid-EEA9F1A9-152E-43B5-AB06-8D475D6165F0', acts as a starting point for events related to scoring. It has two incoming connections from EventBasedGateway1 and Level1 scoring, and it sends data to EventBasedGateway1, EventBasedGateway1, and Level1 scoring.

2. EventBasedGateway1: With the ID'sid-1AD91EE2-D94E-4CB7-872D-7D6A51DDBB81', this gateway is responsible for handling events related to scoring and delay reporting. It receives data from EventBasedGateway0 and Level1 scoring, and sends data to EventBasedGateway0, EventBasedGateway1, and Delay Report.

3. Level1 scoring: This gateway, identified by the IDs'sid-47CE1E5A-B248-4D68-8721-DA6C35325BDD' and'sid-F83C67E5-58EE-4BC8-A758-62AD558548D2', is responsible for processing scoring events at the first level. It receives data from EventBasedGateway0 and EventBasedGateway1, and sends data to EventBasedGateway0 and Scoringback Report.

4. Scoringback Report: This gateway, identified by the ID'sid-F7AEA6EC-366A-4A78-9DF1-2223800B6B31', is responsible for reporting the results of scoring events. It receives data from Level1 scoring and sends data to EventBasedGateway0.

5. EventScoringRequest: This event, identified by
