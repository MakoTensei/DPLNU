 When the necessary scoring request is initiated, it triggers the 'Schufascoring\nnecessary' start event, which in turn sends a message to the 'Scoring result forward' gateway, indicating that the scoring process is required. This gateway then forwards the request to the 'Result\n1. Scoring\nwait' gateway, where the scoring process is initiated and a wait message is sent back.

Simultaneously, the 'Request request' start event sends a message to the 'Report delay' gateway, indicating that a delay in the scoring process has occurred. The 'Delay\nNot applicable' gateway receives this message and forwards the 'Result\nTwo. Scoring\nReport' to the 'Result\nTwo. Scoring\nReport' end event, while also sending the 'Result\n1. Scoring\nReport' to the 'Result\n1. Scoring\nReport' end event.

Once the scoring process is completed, the 'Result\n1. Scoring\nwait' gateway sends a 'Sufa\nScoring\nfinished' message to the 'Sufa\nScoring\nfinished' end event, indicating that the scoring process has been successfully finished.
