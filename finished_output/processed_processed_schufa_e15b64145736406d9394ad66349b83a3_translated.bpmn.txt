 In a seamless workflow, employees initiate a Schufa query, which triggers an IntermediateCatchEvent4. This event is then passed to ExclusiveGateway0, where it is processed and results in a Question completed. Concurrently, a Scoring request is obtained, leading to a Results available? event. This event connects to ExclusiveGateway2, where the Scoring (level 1) and (level 2) events are executed in sequence, ultimately resulting in a Scoring carried out.

Meanwhile, the Scoring Send query event is routed to EventBasedGateway3, which in turn sends IntermediateCatchEvent5 to ExclusiveGateway0. This event completes the question and also feeds into the Results available? event.

Once the Scoring carried out event is completed, it triggers the Interim result report event, which then concludes the process by completing the Question event.

In summary, the workflow begins with a Schufa query by employees, followed by a series of events and gateways that lead to the final Scoring carried out event. The process concludes with the completion of the Question event, providing the desired result of scoring.
