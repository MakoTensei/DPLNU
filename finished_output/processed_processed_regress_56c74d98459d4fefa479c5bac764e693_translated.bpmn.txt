 Upon receiving a 'Regression reported' event, the system initiates a sequence of tasks and gateways to address the issue. First, the 'Check the case' task is triggered, which authorizes the regression and sends a 'Regression authorized?' notification. Concurrently, the 'Set process for resubmission' task is activated, leading to a 'VN contradicts' notification.

Next, the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is executed, resulting in a 'Disclosure of debt collection' notification. Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway4' task is also triggered, leading to a 'Payment confirmed' notification.

Following this, the 'Book payment' task is initiated, closing the process. The 'VN contradicts' task sends a 'Close' notification, and the 'EventBasedGateway3' task results in a 'Disclosure of debt collection' notification.

Finally, the 'Notification sent' task is completed, closing the 'Regression authorized?' process.
