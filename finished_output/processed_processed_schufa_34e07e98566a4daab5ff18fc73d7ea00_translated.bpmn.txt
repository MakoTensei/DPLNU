 In a system designed to process scoring events, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Determine Level 1' process, which then sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. If 'Level 1 OK?' is confirmed, the system proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2', where it receives 'Distribution\ninformation' and 'Start Scoring' messages. The 'Start Scoring' event initiates the 'Request scoring' process, which sends a message to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. Upon successful scoring, a 'Score Redirect' message is generated and sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, 'Expect Level 2' is confirmed, prompting 'ExclusiveGateway2' to forward the message to 'EndEvent1'. This sequence ensures a smooth transition from Level 1 to Level 2 scoring processes.
