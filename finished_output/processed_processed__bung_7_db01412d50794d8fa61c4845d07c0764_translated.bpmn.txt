 The process begins with 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', which triggers 'EventBasedGateway1'. This event then sends a request to 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', which in turn sends a request to 'IntermediateCatchEvent6'. 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' is then forwarded to 'IntermediateCatchEvent7', which performs scoring and sends the result to 'InclusiveGateway2'. 'InclusiveGateway2' then sends the scoring result to 'EndEvent2'. Meanwhile, 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' is triggered by 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' and sends the result to 'EndEvent1'. 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' also triggers 'EndEvent0' through 'EventBasedGateway1'. Finally, 'IntermediateCatchEvent7' sends the scoring result to '1. scoring okay?' through 'InclusiveGateway2'.
