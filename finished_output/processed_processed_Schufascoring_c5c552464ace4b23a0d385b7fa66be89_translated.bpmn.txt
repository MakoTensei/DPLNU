 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'forward scoring information' gateway, which then sends the scoring information to the 'Create a scoring request' task. This task, in turn, sends the information to the 'Information obtained' gateway, which forwards it to the 'Scoring' task. If the 'Result immediately available?' question is answered with 'Yes', the 'Scoring' task sends the result to the 'Scoring result available' endpoint. If the answer is 'No', the 'Report delay' gateway is triggered, which sends the result to the 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' task. This task then sends the result to the 'Scoring result available' endpoint. If the 'Result immediately available?' question is answered with 'No', the 'Scoring' task sends the result to the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task, which then sends the result to the 'Scoring result available' endpoint. The process concludes with the 'Request ready Finished' endpoint.
