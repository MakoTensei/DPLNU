Once the order is ready, it triggers the 'Reception of Payment on request' task, which in turn leads to the 'Enter your order in cash' task.

The 'Enter your order in cash' task is dependent on the 'Order received' event and leads to the 'Money received' task. This task is connected to the'sid-B0B5FEAB-6C35-4F53-B09E-77293FF53CB7' gateway, which then triggers the 'Food pick up' task.

The 'Food pick up' task is dependent on the 'Pieper received' event and leads to the 'Eat food' task. This task is connected to the'sid-CC9B64D0-96FC-47B1-9EA9-9985BA240E9F' gateway, which then triggers the 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Order received' event also leads to the 'Setting into the Empire' task. This task is dependent on the 'Order received' event and leads to the 'EndEvent2' task. The 'EndEvent2' task is connected to the'sid-21498993-7C57-42D6-A8D7-8415658F33B5' gateway, which then triggers the 'EndEvent2'.
