 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Examination\nRegression' task, initiating the 'Send payment request to VN' task, and the 'Check the receipt of funds' task. The 'Send payment request to VN' task sends a message to 'Message VN arrived' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Check the receipt of funds' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Representation' task sends a message to 'Message VN arrived' and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Book now' task connects to 'Representation'. The 'Debt collection companies' task connects to 'Message VN arrived' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Proceedings' task connects to 'Message VN arrived'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives 'StartEvent0' and sends 'EndEvent0' and 'Message VN arrived'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives 'Representation' and sends 'EndEvent0' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' and sends 'EndEvent0'. The 'Message VN arrived' receives 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' and sends 'Debt collection companies' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' receives 'ExclusiveGateway0', 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', and 'Proceedings' and has no outgoing connections.
