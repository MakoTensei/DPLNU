 The process begins with the 'Request Obtained' event, which triggers the 'Start the process' task, sending a 'Request Sent' to the 'Results Obtained' gateway. This gateway then sends the 'Results Obtained' to the 'Follow-up' task, which in turn ends the process with 'End Event 0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Request Obtained' event also triggers the 'Report Delay' task, which sends a 'Request Sent' to the 'Delay Obtained' gateway. This gateway then ends the process with 'End Event 0'.

Meanwhile, the 'Request Obtained' event also triggers the 'Perform Scoring (L1)' task, which sends a 'Request Sent' to the 'Parallel Gateway 2'. This gateway then sends the 'Report the Result' to the 'End Event 1' task, which ends the process.

The 'Request Obtained' event also triggers the 'Report Delay' task, which sends a 'Request Sent' to the 'Parallel Gateway 2'. This gateway then sends the 'Report Delay' to the 'End Event 2' task, which ends the process.

Lastly, the 'Request Obtained' event also triggers the 'Perform Scoring (L2)' task, which sends a 'Request Sent' to the 'Parallel Gateway 2'. This gateway then sends the 'Report the Result' to the 'End Event 2' task, which ends the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Request Obtained' event, which triggers multiple tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'End Event 2' task, which concludes the process.
