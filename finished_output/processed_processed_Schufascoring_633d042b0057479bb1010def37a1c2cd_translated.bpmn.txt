 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check for previous scorings' task, identified by'sid-21AD7DD9-F09E-4D89-8682-8B4DC0AA7923'. This task is designed to determine if there are any existing scores. Upon completion, it sends an 'ExclusiveGateway0' event, which is then handled by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway, identified by'sid-C3140C2E-6C0F-45D4-B2BB-C2E941052301'.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also initiates the '2nd level query' task, identified by'sid-BB4E65F9-BECB-4B16-9AB8-8A0553E5601C'. This task is responsible for querying the second level of the system. The result of this query is then passed to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', identified by'sid-AD7B14A6-DB16-474F-BF55-A6B6203BB080'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' is then directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', identified by'sid-6A9FD779-469B-408D-A31C-6ACFA260C36C'. This gateway handles the event and sends an 'EndEvent0' event, which is then processed by the 'EndEvent0' event, identified by'sid-7CF38A55-C69A-4803-A228-5D7993CCF09B'.

Meanwhile, the 'Determine existing scores' task, identified by'sid-BB4E65F9-BECB-4B16-9AB8-8A0553E5601C', sends an 'EndEvent1' event, identified by'sid-44644F34
