 In a bustling logistics network, three companies initiate a series of offer requests and tasks to streamline their operations. Company 1 sends an offer request to Company 2 and Company 3, both of which receive the offer through ParallelGateway6. In response, Company 2 and Company 3 send their offers back to Company 1 via ParallelGateway7.

Meanwhile, a specialist is tasked with choosing the cheapest offer from Company 2 and Company 3. The specialist receives the offers through ParallelGateway7 and selects the best one, forwarding the decision to ExclusiveGateway3.

ParallelGateway4 is responsible for packaging goods, which are then sent to ParallelGateway5. ExclusiveGateway2 handles the processing of package tickets and insurance inquiries, receiving inputs from large quantity and Is insurance necessary? respectively.

Goods are ready for collection at Company 1, and they are sent to Shipment through ParallelGateway5. Upon delivery, the quantity of goods is checked, and the information is sent back to Shipment through ParallelGateway7.

The logistics network is interconnected through various gateways, with ParallelGateway4 and ParallelGateway6 being the primary entry points for goods. ExclusiveGateway2 serves as a central hub for processing package tickets and insurance inquiries, while ExclusiveGateway3 acts as a key connector between large quantities and Shipment.

The process begins with the delivery of goods, which triggers the offer requests and subsequent tasks. The end of the process is marked by the completion of the shipment, with the final check of the goods' quantity.
