 The process begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the creation of a package ticket through ExclusiveGateway2. Once the package ticket is created, the system checks for a special shipment, which, if present, leads to the selection of a provider and the ordering of expedited shipping. Concurrently, the system also checks for insurance needs, which, if required, leads to the insurance close process through ExclusiveGateway3. Meanwhile, the system prepares the goods for shipping, which involves clarifying the process and packaging the goods. The packaging process is initiated through ParallelGateway4 and leads to ParallelGateway5, which marks the goods as ready for shipping. Throughout this process, the system ensures that all necessary steps are taken to handle special shipments, insurance needs, and the packaging of goods, ultimately leading to the goods being ready for shipping.
