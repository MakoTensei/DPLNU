 In the bustling world of logistics, a series of tasks unfolds to ensure the seamless movement of goods from origin to destination. The journey begins with the dispatch of goods, marked by the event 'Goods are sent' (sid-8335EA1D-44A2-4B28-88C0-380F35D7A35C). This event triggers a cascade of operations, each meticulously designed to handle specific aspects of the shipping process.

Firstly, the goods are directed to 'ParallelGateway5' (sid-B99F5CBB-6D40-4779-8D32-6E4782E5C5DC), where they are prepared for the next phase. Concurrently, an 'Offer arrived?' notification (sid-1) is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0' (sid-469D7230-EA22-47E6-9189-2366577B6A62), which is responsible for handling offers and initiating the process of filling standard package vouchers.

As the goods are being processed, the 'Filling standard package voucher' task (sid-6A77DB3D-2813-4B1B-95DC-4788D17E87DD) is triggered, with 'ParallelGateway5' (sid-B99F5CBB-6D40-4779-8D32-6E4782E5C5DC) as its incoming gateway. This task is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0' (sid-469D7230-EA22-47E6-9189-2366577B6A62), which in turn sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4' (sid-BCC6413A-9B97-452C-85B1-8A8A7C888628) for the 'Offer arrived?'
