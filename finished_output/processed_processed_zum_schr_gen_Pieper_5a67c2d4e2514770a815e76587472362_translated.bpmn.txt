 A customer experiences hunger and decides to select a court to address their needs. They choose the Court of Justice, where they can expect to hear about the Pieper, a special dish. Upon entering the court, they are prompted to add their order, which leads them to learn more about the Court of Justice.

As the customer's hunger persists, they hear the sound of Pieper being prepared. This triggers the court to deliver a judgment, which is then followed by the customer service team providing prepared meals. The customer service team also retrieves the customer to ensure their satisfaction.

In the meantime, the court prepares the necessary facilities, including providing courts and ensuring that food is ready. The court also has a gateway to check if the customer has heard about the Pieper, which leads to the exclusive gateway.

The exclusive gateway directs the customer to either sit in the row or learn more about the Court of Justice. If the customer chooses to sit in the row, they are prompted to add their order. If they choose to learn more, they are directed to the Court of Justice.

Upon hearing the Pieper, the customer is directed to the Court of Justice, where they can expect to receive their judgment. The court then delivers the judgment, and the customer service team provides the prepared meals.

In summary, the customer's hunger leads them to select the Court of Justice, where they learn about the Pieper and receive a judgment. The customer service team ensures that the prepared meals are ready and retrieves the customer to ensure their satisfaction. Meanwhile, the court prepares the necessary facilities and has a gatekeeper to check if the customer has heard about the Pieper.
