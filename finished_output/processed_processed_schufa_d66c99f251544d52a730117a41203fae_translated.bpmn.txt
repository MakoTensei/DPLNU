 In our system, we have a series of tasks and gateways that work together to process scoring requests and report results.

1. When a scoring request is received, it triggers the 'Schufascoring request\nReport' start event. This event initiates the process by forwarding the request to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

2. The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the request and forwards it to the 'Result\nfixed?' gateway. This gateway checks if the scoring result is fixed and sends the result to the 'Scoring result obtained' gateway if it is.

3. If the result is not fixed, the 'Result\nfixed?' gateway sends the result to the 'Delay notification\nobtained' gateway. This gateway then sends a notification to the employees.

4. The 'Delay notification\nobtained' gateway also sends the result to the 'Scoring result obtained' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent1'.

5. The 'Scoring result obtained' gateway also sends the result to the 'Result to\nFrontend\nforward' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent0'.

6. The 'EndEvent0' gateway sends the result to the 'Frontend' and triggers the 'EndEvent1' gateway.

7. The 'EndEvent1' gateway sends the result to the 'Report results to the bank' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent3'.

8. The 'EndEvent3' gateway sends the result to the 'Report results to the bank' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent2'.

9. The 'EndEvent2' gateway sends the result to the 'EndEvent3' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent0'.

10. The 'EndEvent0' gateway sends the result to the 'EndEvent1' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent2'.

11. The 'EndEvent2' gateway sends the result to the 'EndEvent3' gateway, which forwards the result to the 'EndEvent0'.

12. The 'EndEvent0' gateway sends the result to the 'EndEvent1' gateway, which for
