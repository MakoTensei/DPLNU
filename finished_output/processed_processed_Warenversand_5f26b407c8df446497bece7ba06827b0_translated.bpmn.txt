 Starting with the event 'Prepare for delivery', the following sequence of tasks and gateways unfolds:

1. The 'Prepare for delivery' event triggers the 'Clear delivery' task, which has 'ParallelGateway5' as its incoming gateway and 'Special shipment necessary' as its outgoing gateway.

2. The 'Special shipment necessary' task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' with 'ParallelGateway7' as its incoming gateway and 'ExclusiveGateway3' as its outgoing gateway.

3. 'ExclusiveGateway2' has 'ParallelGateway7' and 'Specialist' as its outgoing gateways.

4. The 'Specialist' task, with 'ParallelGateway7' as its incoming gateway, connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

5. 'ExclusiveGateway3' has 'ParallelGateway5', 'ParallelGateway6', and 'Special offer' as its outgoing gateways.

6. The 'Special offer' task, with 'ParallelGateway5' as its incoming gateway, connects to 'ParallelGateway6'.

7. 'ParallelGateway6' has 'ExclusiveGateway3' as its outgoing gateway.

8. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, with 'ParallelGateway5', 'ParallelGateway7', and 'Fill in the mail package' as its incoming gateways, connects to 'ParallelGateway8'.

9. 'ParallelGateway8' has 'Special shipment necessary' and 'ParallelGateway7' as its incoming gateways, and 'Goods delivered' as its outgoing gateway.

10. Finally, the 'Goods delivered' event, with 'ParallelGateway8' as its incoming gateway, marks the end of the sequence.

This flow of tasks and gateways effectively handles the 'Prepare for delivery' event and leads to the 'Goods delivered' event.
