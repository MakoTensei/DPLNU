 When a process starts, it goes through a series of tasks and gateways to ensure proper handling of events and outcomes. Here's a natural flow description of the described tasks and gateways:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' event, which triggers the 'Proceedings' task. This task sends the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

2. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'StartEvent0' and directs the process to the 'EventBasedGateway4'.

3. The 'EventBasedGateway4' receives the 'StartEvent0' and sends the process to two tasks: 'Include collection' and 'Objection justified?'.

4. The 'Include collection' task checks for a regression and, if found, sends the process to the 'Check regression' task.

5. The 'Check regression' task, upon completion, sends the process to the 'Set process for resubmission' task.

6. The 'Set process for resubmission' task sends the process to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'.

7. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task, upon completion, sends the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

8. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Check regression' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' tasks and sends the process to the 'Close' task if the objection is justified.

9. The 'Close' task, upon completion, sends the process to the 'EndEvent0'.

10. If the objection is not justified, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the process to the 'Book money receipt' task.

11. The 'Book money receipt' task, upon completion, sends the process to the 'EndEvent0'.

12. If the 'Reimbursement deadline expired' event occurs, the process goes through the 'EventBasedGateway4' and ends at 'EndEvent1'.

This flow ensures that the process is handled efficiently and accurately, with each task and gateway contributing to the overall outcome.
