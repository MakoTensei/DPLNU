 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the scoring process. The first task, 'Scoring Level 1', is triggered by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and results in 'Results calculated'. The 'Results calculated' then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn receives 'Scoring Level 1' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends the results to 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the scoring process.
