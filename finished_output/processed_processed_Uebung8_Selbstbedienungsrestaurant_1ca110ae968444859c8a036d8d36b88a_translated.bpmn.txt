 A customer experiences hunger, triggering the 'Add your order' process, which leads to placing an order. Once the order is obtained, it goes through several stages:

1. The customer waits for their turn, indicated by 'Waiting to the row\n'.
2. The order is prepared, and the kitchen staff is informed, as shown by 'Putting meal in vain'.
3. The customer receives the meal and is handed back to the server, resulting in 'Handed over meal and take pepser back'.

During this process, the customer may experience nausea, which is captured by the 'Waiting to the row\n' gateway, leading to 'nausea\n'.

The order completion is signaled by '5min', which is the time the customer spends retrieving their guest.

The entire process is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0', which connects the different stages and events, ensuring a smooth dining experience.
