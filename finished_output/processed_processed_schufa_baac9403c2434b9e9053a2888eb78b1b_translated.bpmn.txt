 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Request Schufascoring' task, which sends a 'Feedback\nReport' to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task then proceeds to 'forwarding scoring result', which in turn leads to 'EndEvent0' through 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'First Schufascoring\nperform' task, sending a 'StartEvent1' to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task then moves to 'Report delay', which sends a 'Second scoring\nperform' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Second scoring\nperform' task concludes with 'EndEvent1' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the process involves a series of tasks and gateways that work together to perform Schufascoring, with 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1' initiating the process, and 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' marking its conclusion.
