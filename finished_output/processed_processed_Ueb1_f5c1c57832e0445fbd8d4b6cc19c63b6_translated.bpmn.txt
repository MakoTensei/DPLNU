 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'Delivering goods' task, where incoming information is 'Shipping costs\nobtained' and the task's output is 'Shipping costs\nFinished'. This output then leads to the 'Wastewater?' task, which has 'Shipping costs\nobtained' as its incoming information and outputs 'Shipping costs\nFinished'.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' event also triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, with 'Shipping costs\nobtained' as its incoming information and 'ParallelGateway5' as its output. The 'Packaging goods' task's output then leads to the '3 offers' task, which has 'ParallelGateway4' as its incoming information and outputs 'Select your offer'.

The 'Select your offer' task, with 'Lot?' as its incoming information, leads to the 'Specialist' task, which has 'Lot?' as its incoming information and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' task's output then leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which has 'Lot?' as its incoming information and outputs 'Check insurance requirements'.

The 'Check insurance requirements' task, with 'Lot?' as its incoming information, leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which has 'Lot?' and 'Wastewater?' as its incoming information and outputs 'Shipping costs\nFinished'.

The 'Complete insurance' task, with 'Wastewater?' as its incoming information, leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which has 'Lot?' and 'Complete insurance' as its incoming information and outputs 'Shipping costs\nFinished'.

Finally, the 'Shipping costs\nFinished' event, with 'Wastewater?' as its incoming information, triggers the 'Delivering goods' task, which has 'Shipping costs\nFinished' as its incoming information and outputs 'Shipping costs\nFinished'.
