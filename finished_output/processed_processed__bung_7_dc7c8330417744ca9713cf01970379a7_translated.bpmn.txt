 In the scoring process, a Request request initiates the workflow. This request triggers a Scoring request, which then leads to Results obtained. The Results obtained are then forwarded to an ExclusiveGateway0, resulting in an EndEvent0.

Simultaneously, the Request request also triggers a Report delay due to a delay of 1 minute. This delay is then forwarded to Level 2 Scoring, which subsequently sends the results to ExclusiveGateway0, resulting in EndEvent1.

Meanwhile, the Request request also triggers a Level 1 Scoring process. The Level 1 Scoring process completes and sends the results to Level 1 scoring finished, which then sends the results to ExclusiveGateway0, resulting in EndEvent1.

In summary, the workflow involves a Request request leading to multiple scoring processes and delay reporting, with the results being sent to ExclusiveGateway0, resulting in EndEvent0 and EndEvent1.
