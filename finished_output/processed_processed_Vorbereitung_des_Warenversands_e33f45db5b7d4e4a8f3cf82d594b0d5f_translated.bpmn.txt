 The process begins with the 'Sending goods' event, which triggers the 'Task1' to handle the dispatch of goods. This task is designed to handle large quantities, so it connects to the 'large quantity?' gateway. The 'Task1' then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn connects to the 'Order Spediteuer' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Task1' also connects to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task through the 'ParallelGateway3'. This task is responsible for selecting the most cost-effective offer for the dispatched goods.

Meanwhile, the 'large quantity?' gateway also connects to the 'Preparing mail' task, which prepares the package note for the dispatched goods. This task then connects to the 'Filling the package note' task through the 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Filling the package note' task then connects to the 'Is insurance necessary?' task, which determines whether insurance is required for the dispatched goods. If insurance is necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered.

Lastly, the 'large quantity?' gateway also connects to the 'Task12' task through the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is responsible for completing any remaining tasks related to the dispatch of large quantities.

In summary, the process involves several tasks and gateways working together to efficiently dispatch large quantities of goods, select the best offer, prepare and package the goods, and determine if insurance is necessary.
