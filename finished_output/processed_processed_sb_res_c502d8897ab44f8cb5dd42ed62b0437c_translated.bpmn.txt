 In this system, the process of ordering and preparing food is managed through a series of interconnected tasks and gateways. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. The process begins with the 'Hunger' event, where the guest expresses their need for food. This event triggers the 'Food provided' task, which sends the food order to the kitchen.

2. The 'Food order\nReport' event is generated, containing the details of the food order. This event triggers the 'inform employees' task, which notifies the kitchen staff about the order.
