 Starting with the event 'possible regression against VN', the system initiates a series of tasks and interactions through various gateways and services. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. The event 'possible regression against VN' triggers the task 'Check regression'. This task is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for handling incoming messages related to potential regressions.

2. Upon receiving the 'Check regression' task, 'ExclusiveGateway3' forwards the message to 'Proceedings', which is another task that requires the completion of the process.

3. Concurrently, 'Check regression' also sends a message to 'Set case for resubmission', which is tasked with creating a case for resubmission if a regression is confirmed.

4. 'Set case for resubmission' sends a notification to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which is responsible for handling notifications related to resubmission cases.

5. Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway3' also receives a message from 'EventBasedGateway6', which is triggered by the incoming event 'possible regression\nagainst VN'. This event is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

6. 'ExclusiveGateway5' is responsible for handling incoming messages related to 'Regression\n?' and 'Money received?'. It forwards the 'Regression\n?' message to 'Complete the process' and the 'Money received?' message to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

7. 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Regression\n?' message and forwards it to 'EventBasedGateway6', which is responsible for handling events related to regressions.

8. 'EventBasedGateway6' forwards the 'Regression\n?' message to 'Complete the process' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' again.

9. 'ExclusiveGateway3' also receives the 'Money received?' message and forwards it to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway5'.

10. 'ExclusiveGateway
