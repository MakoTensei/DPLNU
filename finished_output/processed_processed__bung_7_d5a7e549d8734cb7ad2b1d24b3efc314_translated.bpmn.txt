 The process begins with the 'START\nSchufa show' event, which triggers the preparation of a delay for the Level 2 Scoring Result. This event sends an incoming message to the 'EventBasedGateway2', which in turn sends an intermediate event, 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', to the 'Preparing scoring ad' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Request\nby Bank' event initiates the process by sending an incoming message to the 'Level 1 available?' gateway. This gateway, after processing the request, sends an intermediate event, 'ParallelGateway3', to the 'Send Scoring Level 1 to Bank' task.

The 'Send Scoring Level 1 to Bank' task, upon receiving the intermediate event, sends an outgoing message to the 'END' event, marking the completion of the Level 1 Scoring process.

Meanwhile, the 'Level 1 available?' gateway, after processing the incoming request, sends an intermediate event, 'IntermediateGateway1', to the 'Prepare Scoring L2 MSG' task.

The 'Prepare Scoring L2 MSG' task, upon receiving the intermediate event, sends an outgoing message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, after processing the incoming message, sends an intermediate event, 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', to the 'Preparing Delay for Level 2 Scoring Result' task.

The 'Preparing Delay for Level 2 Scoring Result' task, upon receiving the intermediate event, sends an outgoing message to the 'View MSG delay\nPreparing' task.

The 'View MSG delay\nPreparing' task, after processing the incoming message, sends an intermediate event, 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', to the 'Send a message' task.

The 'Send a message' task, upon receiving the intermediate event, sends an outgoing message to the 'END' event, marking the completion of the Level 2 Scoring process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'START\nSchufa show' event, which triggers the preparation of a delay for the Level 2 Scoring
