Once the shipping type is decided, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered, which requires the 'Goods be sent' information. The 'Filling the package note' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'Pick up and select offers' task is initiated by the 'Type of shipping?' gateway, leading to the selection of a 'Selected forwarder'. This task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'Spediteur 3' and 'Spediteur 2' tasks are also connected to the 'Selected forwarder' and ultimately to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'Spediteur 1 commission' task is associated with the 'Selected forwarder' and also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'.
