 In the process of handling a Schufa request, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' and immediately sends a pickup request to the Schufa system, represented by 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. Once the Schufa request is received, the system proceeds to perform scoring level 1 and level 2, which are processed by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The scoring results are then sent to the frontend, as indicated by 'Outputting Scoring Value to Frontend'. Concurrently, a delay message is dispatched to the frontend via 'Send delay message to Frontend'.

Simultaneously, the system also sends a delay message to the bank using 'Send delay message to Bank'. Upon completion of the scoring process, the system generates a 'Scoring Result' and concludes the process with 'EndEvent1'. The entire workflow is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway2', which ensures that the scoring levels are processed correctly and the results are delivered to the frontend and the bank.
