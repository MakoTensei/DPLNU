 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the determination of the shipping method. This task is handled by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which has two outcomes: filling out standard package tickets and choosing the cheapest offer. The latter leads to a specialist who then directs the process to 'ExclusiveGateway2', where the packaging of goods takes place.

Simultaneously, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' also sends the process to 'InclusiveGateway3' for insurance requirements. Here, three offers are presented, and the cheapest one is selected.

The 'ParallelGateway4' is responsible for filling out standard package tickets and supplying goods for shipping. It also sends the process to 'InclusiveGateway3' for insurance requirements and 'EndEvent0'.

The 'InclusiveGateway3' handles the insurance requirements and sends the process to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with determining the shipping method, filling out standard package tickets, choosing the cheapest offer, packaging goods, and supplying goods for shipping. It ends with the completion of insurance requirements and the finalization of the shipping process.
