 The process begins with a 'Shipment Required' event, which triggers the initiation of the packaging goods task. This task is assigned to 'ParallelGateway4', which receives the incoming request and sends out a 'Packaging goods' task with an 'outgoing' connection to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Once the goods are packaged, the 'Delivering goods' task is triggered, which is also assigned to 'ParallelGateway5'. This task receives the incoming request from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends out a 'Goods delivered' event as its 'outgoing' connection.

Before the goods are delivered, the 'Explain the shipping receipt' task is initiated, which is assigned to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task receives the incoming request and sends out a 'large amount?' event to 'Gateway sid-793E1779-E332-41F8-B264-57A169466E6F'.

The 'large amount?' event is then received by 'Gateway sid-793E1779-E332-41F8-B264-57A169466E6F', which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task receives the incoming request and sends out a 'Check insurance requirements' event to 'Gateway sid-B71F428A-C72A-4C6B-A548-C82E09C42DBB'.

The 'Check insurance requirements' event is received by 'Gateway sid-B71F428A-C72A-4C6B-A548-C82E09C42DBB', which triggers the 'Complete insurance' task. This task receives the incoming request and sends out a 'ExclusiveGateway3' event.

Finally, the 'ExclusiveGateway3' event is received by 'Gateway sid-C648074B-7EBE-40BF-96A3-C262C8EC2E3
