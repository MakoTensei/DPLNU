 Upon receiving a 'Regressive report', the system initiates a sequence of tasks and interactions between various gateways and services. The process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Regressive report' triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which then sends a 'Get money' request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

2. Concurrently, the 'Regressive report' also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway6', which sends a 'Transfer of debt collection service provider' request to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Get money' request and sends a 'Close' signal to the 'Right to object?' gateway.

4. The 'EventBasedGateway6' sends the 'Transfer of debt collection service provider' request to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then closes the process.

5. Meanwhile, the 'Right to object?' gateway receives the 'Close' signal and sends a 'Close' signal to the 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

6. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' also sends a 'Get money' request to the 'ExclusiveGateway5'.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway4' receives the 'Close' signal and sends a 'Close' signal to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

8. Finally, the 'Close' signal from the 'ExclusiveGateway1' triggers the 'Close' signal at the end of the process.

This sequence of events ensures that the 'Regressive report' is handled efficiently, with the appropriate tasks and services being triggered and completed in a logical order.
