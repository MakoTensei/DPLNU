 Starting with the event 'Goods be sent', the process unfolds as follows:

1. The goods are sent, triggering the 'Goods be sent' event.
2. This event initiates a conversation with 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for handling the 'A lot?' query.
3. 'ParallelGateway6' then connects with 'A lot?', which in turn links to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Insurance necessary?' query and forwards it to both 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway7'.
5. 'ParallelGateway7' is also connected to 'Insurance necessary?' and receives the query.
6. Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway6' also connects to 'ParallelGateway7' to continue the process.
7. 'ParallelGateway7' then handles the 'Insurance necessary?' query and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
8. 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Insurance necessary?' query and connects to 'ParallelGateway4'.
9. 'ParallelGateway4' is connected to 'Insurance necessary?' and 'ExclusiveGateway3', and it also connects to 'ParallelGateway5' twice.
10. 'ParallelGateway5' receives the 'Insurance necessary?' query and connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
11. 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Insurance necessary?' query and connects to 'ParallelGateway7'.
12. 'ParallelGateway7' handles the 'Insurance necessary?' query and sends the goods to 'Goods made available'.
13. Finally, the goods are made available, marking the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which leads to a series of connections and queries between various gateways, ultimately resulting in the 'Goods made available' event.
