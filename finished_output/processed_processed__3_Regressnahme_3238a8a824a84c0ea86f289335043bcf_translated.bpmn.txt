 When a 'Regression check reported' event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure a thorough investigation and resolution process. Here's how the flow unfolds:

1. The 'Regression check reported' event initiates the 'Check regression claim' task, which has an exclusive gateway leading to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
2. 'ExclusiveGateway5' receives the 'Regression check reported' event and forwards it to 'Set process for resubmission' task. This task has an exclusive gateway leading to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.
3. 'ExclusiveGateway4' receives the 'Set process for resubmission' event and forwards it to 'Book payment' task. This task has an exclusive gateway leading to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway5' receives the 'Book payment' event and forwards it to 'Complete the process' task. This task has an exclusive gateway leading to 'Process'.
5. The 'Process' task receives the'regression\npossible?' event from 'ExclusiveGateway5' and forwards it to 'Proceedings' task. This task has an exclusive gateway leading to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Proceedings' event and forwards it to 'Dispense process for collection service' task. This task has an exclusive gateway leading to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
7. 'ExclusiveGateway5' receives the 'Dispense process for collection service' event and forwards it to 'Process'.

In summary, the 'Regression check reported' event initiates a chain of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Process' task, which concludes the investigation and resolution process.
