 When a case is taken back into regress, a message is sent to initiate the process. This message triggers a re-submission event, which in turn leads to an examination of the reasons for the regress. If the rejection of payment is justified, the case is rejected. Concurrently, a debt collection agency is alerted. If the reasons for rejection are not justified, the case is re-submitted, prompting a re-examination of the reasons. If the case has been in regress for two weeks, it is marked as repeated. Additionally, if money has been received, the process concludes with a money receipt event.


Starting with the 'Take VN in Regress' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. A 'Send a message' event is triggered to initiate the re-submission process.

2. The 'Regress?' event is triggered, leading to a 'Set on re-submission' event.

3. The 'Set on re-submission' event prompts an 'Examination' event to determine if the rejection of payment is justified.

4. If the rejection is justified, the 'Debt collection agency' event is triggered, and the case is marked as 'Rejection of payment justified?' with an 'EndEvent1' outcome.

5. If the rejection is not justified, the 'Reasons' event is triggered, leading to another 'Set on re-submission' event.

6. The 'Set on re-submission' event can also be triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway2' event, which can lead to either 'Rejection of payment justified?' or 'EndEvent1' outcomes.

7. If the case has been in regress for two weeks, the 'Repeated 2 weeks' event is triggered, leading to an 'EndEvent1' outcome.

8. If money has been received, the 'Money received' event is triggered, leading to an 'EndEvent2' outcome.


The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', and 'EndEvent2' events, marking the end of the respective paths within the workflow.
