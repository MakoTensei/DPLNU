 When a possible regression is reported, the process begins with the 'possible regression start' event. This triggers a series of tasks and gateways to handle the situation:

1. The 'possible regression start' event initiates the 'Send payment request' task, which sends a payment request to the customer.
2. The 'Send payment request' task has an incoming link to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which determines if the regression is justified for a rejection of payment.
3. If the 'Regress possible?' gateway determines that the regression is justified, it sends the case to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' with an 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which proceeds to the 'Case closed' task.
4. If the 'Regress possible?' gateway determines that the regression is not justified, it sends the case to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' with an 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which proceeds to the 'Case for completion\nDebt collection' task.
5. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task sends the case to the 'EventBasedGateway5' with an 'EventBasedGateway5' task, which can lead to the 'Case closed' task or the 'give case to debt collection service providers' task.
6. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task sends the case to the 'EventBasedGateway5' with an 'EventBasedGateway5' task, which can lead to the 'Case for completion\nDebt collection' task or the 'Cancellation period expired without reaction Customer' task.

In summary, when a possible regression is reported, the process involves sending a payment request, evaluating the regression, and determining the appropriate course of action based on the evaluation. The process can lead to either closing the case, proceeding with debt collection, or escalating the case to debt collection service providers.
