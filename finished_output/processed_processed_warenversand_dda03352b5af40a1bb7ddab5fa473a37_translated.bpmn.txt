 When goods are sent, the process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is responsible for selecting the appropriate offer for the large amount of goods being shipped. The selection process involves the 'Select your offer' task, which receives input from the 'large amount?' gateway. Once an offer is selected, the 'Specialist' task is engaged, which also receives input from the 'large amount?' gateway. The specialist then directs the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for handling the shipping details.

Simultaneously, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which also receives input from the 'large amount?' gateway. This task is responsible for completing the necessary documentation for the shipment. The 'Complete insurance' task is triggered next, which requires input from the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway. This task ensures that the shipment is properly insured.

The 'Packaging goods' task is then activated, receiving input from the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is responsible for packaging the goods for shipment. Once the goods are packaged, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is triggered, which receives input from the 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is responsible for making the goods available for collection.

In summary, the process of shipping large amounts of goods involves several tasks and gateways working together to ensure a smooth and efficient shipping experience. The 'Specialist' task plays a crucial role in coordinating the various steps involved in the shipping process.
