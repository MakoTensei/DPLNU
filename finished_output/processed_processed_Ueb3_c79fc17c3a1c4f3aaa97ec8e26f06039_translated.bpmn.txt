 The process begins with the submission of a 'Regression possibility' event, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and processes.

1. The 'Regression possibility' event is received, and it initiates the 'Send a payment request' task. This task is connected to the 'Send a payment request' gateway, which has incoming connections from the 'Regression possibility' event.

2. The 'Send a payment request' task is then routed to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which has incoming connections from the 'Send a payment request' task.

3. Upon reaching 'ExclusiveGateway3', the task is forwarded to the 'Process unsuccessful closed' task. This task is connected to the 'Process unsuccessful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

4. The 'Process unsuccessful closed' task is then routed to the 'Cash receipt not applicable' gateway, which has incoming connections from the 'Process unsuccessful closed' task.

5. The 'Cash receipt not applicable' gateway then sends a 'Process successful closed' task to the 'Process successful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Cash receipt not applicable'.

6. The 'Process successful closed' gateway sends a 'Close' task to the 'Close' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Process successful closed'.

7. The 'Close' gateway then sends a 'Process successful closed' task to the 'Process successful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Close'.

8. The 'Process successful closed' gateway sends a 'Process successful closed' task to the 'Process successful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Process successful closed'.

9. The 'Process successful closed' gateway sends a 'Process successful closed' task to the 'Process successful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Process successful closed'.

10. The 'Process successful closed' gateway sends a 'Process successful closed' task to the 'Process successful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Process successful closed'.

11. The 'Process successful closed' gateway sends a 'Process successful closed' task to the 'Process successful closed' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'Process successful closed'.
