 In the system, there are several tasks and gateways that work together to process scoring desired events and report the results.

1. When a scoring desired event occurs, it triggers the "Scoring Desired" start event. This event can either lead to the "Report the Final Result" or "Report Delay" end events.

2. The "Report the Final Result" end event sends the incoming data to the "Result Present?" gateway. This gateway then forwards the data to the "Level 2 Scoring Reported" and "Level 2: " outgoing end events.

3. The "Report Delay" end event sends the incoming data to the "Delay Reported" gateway. This gateway then forwards the data to the "Report Delay" outgoing end event.

4. The "EventBasedGateway1" gateway receives the incoming data from the "Scoring Desired" start event and forwards it to the "Level 1 Scoring Reported" and "Delay Reported" outgoing end events.

5. The "Request Schufa" task sends incoming data to the "Results Obtained" gateway, which then forwards the data to the "Level 1 Scoring Reported" outgoing end event.

6. The "Delay Reported" task sends incoming data to the "Report Delay" gateway, which then forwards the data to the "Report Delay" outgoing end event.

7. The "End Result Obtained" task sends incoming data to the "Level 2 Scoring Reported" gateway, which then forwards the data to the "Level 2: " outgoing end event.

8. The "Scoring Level 2" task receives incoming data from the "Result Present?" gateway and forwards it to the "Report Scoring" outgoing end event.

9. The "Report Scoring" task receives incoming data from the "Result Present?" gateway and forwards it to the "Level 2: " outgoing end event.

10. The "Scoring Level 2" task receives incoming data from the "Report Scoring" gateway and forwards it to the "Report Delay" outgoing end event.

11. The "Report Delay" task receives incoming data from
