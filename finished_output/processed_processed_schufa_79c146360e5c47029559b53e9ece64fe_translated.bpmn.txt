 In the scoring process, a scoring question entry triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The first task, 'Processing scoring request and sending', receives the scoring question entry and sends a delay to meet the next step. This task is linked to 'Scoring Level 1', which processes the question and sends the result. The 'Scoring Level 1' task then connects to 'Scoring Level 2', which further processes the question and sends the result.

The 'Scoring Level 1' task also connects to the 'Scoring is fixed' gateway, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level 2'. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring Level 2' task connects to the 'Scoring meets' gateway, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level 1'.

The 'Scoring Level 1' task also connects to the 'Date wait' gateway, which sends the scoring request to 'Scoring Level 2' and meets a delay. The 'Scoring Level 2' task connects to the 'Scoring meets' gateway, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level 1'.

The process starts with the 'Scoring Question Entry' event, which triggers the 'Processing scoring request and sending' task. This task then sends a delay to meet the 'Scoring Level 1' task. The 'Scoring Level 1' task processes the question and sends the result to the 'Result send' event. The 'Scoring Level 1' task also connects to the 'Scoring is fixed' gateway, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level 2'. The 'Scoring Level 2' task processes the question and sends the result to the 'Result send' event. The 'Scoring Level 2' task also connects to the 'Scoring meets' gateway, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level 1'.

The process ends with the 'Scoring meets' gateway, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level 1'. The 'Scoring Level 1' task then connects to the 'Scoring Level 2' task, which sends the result and redirects to 'Scoring Level
