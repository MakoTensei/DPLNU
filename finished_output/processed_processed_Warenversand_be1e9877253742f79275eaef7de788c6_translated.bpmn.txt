 When a shipment arrives, the process begins with the 'Goods\nShipping' event, which triggers the 'courses' task to set the quantity. This task then sends the shipment to 'ParallelGateway3'. From there, the shipment is directed to 'Fill in the package voucher' task, which checks if insurance is desired and sends the shipment to 'Insurance desired?\n'. If insurance is chosen, the shipment proceeds to 'Insurance close' task, which sends the shipment to 'ParallelGateway4'. Concurrently, the 'Packaging goods' task also sends the shipment to 'ParallelGateway4'. Meanwhile, the 'Choose your favorite' task, which is initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway0', sends the shipment to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Finally, the shipment reaches its destination through 'ParallelGateway4'.
