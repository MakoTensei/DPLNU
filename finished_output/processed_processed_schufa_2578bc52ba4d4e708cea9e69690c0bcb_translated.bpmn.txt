 In a seamless workflow, the scoring process begins with a 'Scoring Start request' that triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which in turn sends a 'Result?' request to the 'Result?' gateway. This request is then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which directs the 'Result Scoring 1' task to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Result Scoring 1' task then sends a 'Request completed' event to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which concludes the scoring process.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring Start request' also initiates the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which sends a'sid-8B2D0334-6652-4CBF-9003-6B55AD3F26B4' request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This request is then forwarded to 'Result Scoring 2', which sends a 'Request completed' event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Meanwhile, the 'Request request' event triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which sends a 'Result?' request to the 'Result?' gateway. This request is then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which directs the 'Result Scoring 1' task to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Result Scoring 1' task then sends an 'Info about delay' event to 'Info about delay', which concludes the scoring process.

Additionally, the 'Scoring Start request' also initiates the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which sends a'sid-2398E97D-5F74-4720-B568-B2DCB74EEE89' request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This request is then forwarded to 'Result Scoring 2', which sends a 'Request completed' event to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

In summary, the scoring process involves multiple tasks and gateways, with 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' serving as critical points of convergence for the incoming and outgoing
