 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' task, which checks the quantity of goods to be shipped. This task then connects to the 'Check quantity' task, which determines the necessary quantity of goods for shipping.

Next, the 'Shipping goods' task also connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Request 3 forwarders' task. This task is responsible for selecting three forwarders to handle the shipping process.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping goods' task also connects to the 'Type of shipping?' task, which is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway handles the insurance requirements and connects to the 'Complete insurance' task.

The 'Complete insurance' task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for delivering the goods.

In summary, the process involves shipping goods, checking the quantity, selecting forwarders, determining the type of shipping, handling insurance requirements, and finally delivering the goods.
