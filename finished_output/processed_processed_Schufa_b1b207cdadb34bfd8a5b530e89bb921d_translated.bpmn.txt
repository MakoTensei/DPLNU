 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Scoring message onbrereiten' gateway, which then sends a 'Prepare delay message' to the 'Scoring\n?' gateway. The 'Scoring\n?' gateway, in turn, sends a 'Scoring immediately\navailable?' message to the 'Determining scoring' gateway, which triggers 'Determining scoring' and subsequently 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring immediately\navailable?' message also triggers 'Level 2 scoring' at the 'EndEvent2' gateway. Once the scoring is determined, the 'Scoring message onbrereiten' gateway sends an 'EndEvent0' message, concluding the process.
