 The system initiates a regression procedure, which triggers the creation of a payment prompt. This payment prompt is then directed to ExclusiveGateway1, where it can either proceed to a Regression exam completion or be directed to ExclusiveGateway4 based on the 'Do you mind?' inquiry.

If the user agrees to proceed with the Regression exam, the exam is completed, and the system sends a notification to the user. This notification can lead to two possible outcomes: it can either direct the user to ExclusiveGateway1 for further processing or to ExclusiveGateway4 for debt collection.

Alternatively, if the user does not agree to proceed with the Regression exam, the payment prompt is directed to ExclusiveGateway4, which leads to debt collection.

In the case of a 'Defining deadline' event, it is triggered by the ParallelGateway7 and leads to a 'Check payment receipt' task. The payment receipt task is then directed to ExclusiveGateway1, where it can either proceed to a Regression exam completion or be directed to ExclusiveGateway4 based on the 'Correct entrance?' inquiry.

The 'Representation' event is triggered by the ParallelGateway7 and leads to a 'Book payment' task. This task is directed to ExclusiveGateway4, which leads to debt collection.

In summary, the system processes a regression procedure, which can lead to either a Regression exam completion or debt collection based on user responses. The 'Defining deadline' and 'Representation' events also lead to tasks that can result in Regression exam completion or debt collection.
