 When a user initiates a scoring inquiry, the process begins with the 'Start your inquiry' task, which triggers a 'Schufascoring requested' event. This event then leads to the 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway, which in turn performs 'Scoring Level 1' and reports a 'Delay'. The 'Scoring Level 1' task is then completed, and the 'Scoring Level 1 shipped' task is triggered, indicating that the scoring process has been successfully initiated and shipped.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' event triggers the 'Exception?' gateway, which handles any exceptions that may arise during the scoring process. Once the 'Scoring Level 1' task is completed, the 'EndEvent1' event is triggered, marking the end of the first level of scoring.

In summary, the process starts with a user inquiry, followed by a scoring request, which leads to the initiation and shipping of the scoring process. The process is monitored by event-based gateways, which handle exceptions and report delays. The process concludes with the completion of the first level of scoring.
