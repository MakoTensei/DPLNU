 When a customer initiates an enquiry, the process begins at the 'StartEvent0' and flows through the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then diverges into two paths: the 'Shipment Standard' process and the 'Goods dispatch large' process. The 'Shipment Standard' process continues through 'ParallelGateway2', leading to the 'Filling parcel note' and 'Packing' tasks. Meanwhile, the 'Goods dispatch large' process selects a supplier through 'ExclusiveGateway1' and then proceeds to 'ParallelGateway2', where it completes the 'Filling parcel note' and 'Packing' tasks. Both processes ultimately converge at 'ParallelGateway3', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'Goods dispatch large' process also includes a direct path to 'EndEvent0' through 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Additionally, the 'Complete insurance' task can be initiated from 'ParallelGateway2' and also leads to 'EndEvent0'.
