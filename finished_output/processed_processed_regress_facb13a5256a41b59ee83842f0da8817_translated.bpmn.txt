 Let's trace the flow of events starting from the 'Regression possibility submitted' and ending with the 'Regression case unsuccessful closed':

1. 'Regression possibility submitted' triggers 'Send a message' to initiate the process.
2. 'Send a message' then connects to 'Check the case' to further investigate the possibility.
3. 'Check the case' leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which determines if the case is justified.
4. If the case is justified, 'ExclusiveGateway3' forwards the case to 'Regression case unsuccessful closed'.
5. If the case is not justified, 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the case to 'Regression case debt collection forwarded' if the reimbursement period has expired.
6. 'Regression case debt collection forwarded' connects to 'Reimbursement period Expired' to check if the reimbursement period has expired.
7. If the reimbursement period has expired, the case is forwarded to 'Regression case debt collection forwarded'.
8. If the reimbursement period has not expired, the case is forwarded to 'Regression case successful completed' after receiving the 'Payment Report'.
9. 'Regression case successful completed' marks the end of the successful case.
10. If the case is not justified, it leads to 'Regression case unsuccessful closed' after being forwarded to 'EventBasedGateway4'.

This flow of events ensures that the regression possibility is thoroughly investigated and handled appropriately, leading to either a successful completion or an unsuccessful closure of the case.
