 When a "Scoring request" event occurs, it triggers a sequence of tasks and gateways to process the request and provide a scoring result. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. A "Scoring request" event is initiated, which starts the process.
2. The event triggers the "Schufascoring clicked" gateway, which sends a "Result" event.
3. The "Result" event is then routed to the "Level 1 Scoring" task, which checks for any delays in the investigation of scoring.
4. If there is a delay, the "Level 1 Scoring" task sends the "Delay in Investigation of scoring?" event to the "Delay in\nInvestigation of scoring?" gateway.
5. The "Delay in\nInvestigation of scoring?" gateway sends an "End" event to indicate the delay.
6. If there is no delay, the "Level 1 Scoring" task proceeds to the "Level 2 Scoring" task.
7. The "Level 2 Scoring" task also checks for any delays and sends the "Delay in\nInvestigation of scoring?" event to the same gateway if needed.
8. If there is no delay, the "Level 2 Scoring" task sends the "Result" event to the "Results obtained" gateway.
9. The "Results obtained" gateway sends an "End" event to indicate the successful completion of the scoring process.
10. If there was a delay, the "Delay in\nInvestigation of scoring?" gateway sends a "Delay\nReport" event to the "Report delay" gateway.
11. The "Report delay" gateway sends an "End" event to indicate the delay report.
12. The "Scoring request" event also triggers the "Report the scoring result" gateway, which sends an "End" event to complete the process.

In summary, the process starts with a "Scoring request" event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways to investigate and provide a scoring result. If there is a delay, the process includes additional steps to report the delay. The process concludes with an "End" event, indicating the completion of the scoring process.
