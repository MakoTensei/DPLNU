 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the packaging and shipping of goods. The packaged goods are then checked by the secretariat to determine if a special shipment is necessary. If it is, the process diverges into two paths: one for a special shipment and one for a standard shipment.

For a special shipment, the goods are filled with a package note and insurance is considered. The package note is filled, and the insurance decision is made. If insurance is needed, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If not, the goods are ready for collection.

For a standard shipment, the goods are filled with a package note, and the insurance decision is made. If insurance is needed, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If not, the goods are ready for collection.

The goods are then offered to freight forwarders, and the cheapest offer is chosen. The chosen offer leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', where the goods are ready for collection.

In the case of a special shipment, the goods are first offered to freight forwarders. The cheapest offer is chosen, and the goods are ready for collection.

Throughout the process, the goods are also offered to freight forwarders at different stages, and the cheapest offer is chosen.

The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', where the goods are ready for collection.
