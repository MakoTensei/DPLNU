 In a bustling warehouse, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the process. This event triggers the 'Offer Spediteur A' to kick off the operations. Following this, the 'ParallelGateway2' checks the quantity of the goods, ensuring everything is in order before moving forward.

Simultaneously, the 'Packaging goods' task commences, utilizing 'ParallelGateway2' to package the items efficiently. Once the packaging is complete, the 'Filling the package note' task takes over, using 'ParallelGateway5' to fill the necessary documentation.

Meanwhile, the 'Offer Spediteur A' continues its journey through 'ParallelGateway3', eventually leading to the 'Cheapest offer' task. This task is responsible for finding the most cost-effective shipping option for the goods.

The 'Offer Spediteur C' and 'Offer Spediteur B' also make their way through 'ParallelGateway4', both aiming to secure the best shipping deals.

As the goods are packaged and the offers are made, the 'Procurement' task takes over, using 'ParallelGateway5' to ensure the goods meet the required quality standards.

Finally, the 'Complete insurance' task wraps up the process, using 'ExclusiveGateway1' to provide the necessary insurance coverage for the goods.

Throughout this entire process, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' serves as the central hub, receiving goods from 'ParallelGateway2' and distributing them to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway5'. Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway5' acts as the final destination, where the 'Good quality' event concludes the workflow, ensuring the goods have met all the necessary requirements.
