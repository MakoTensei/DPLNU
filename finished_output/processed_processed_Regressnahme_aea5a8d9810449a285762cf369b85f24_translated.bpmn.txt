 In the event of a potential regression, the system initiates a series of tasks and processes to manage the situation. The process begins with the 'VN potential in Regress to take' event, which triggers the booking of the entrance at 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, a 'possibility of regression' check is initiated, which can lead to either the 'Regression possible?' or 'Opposition justified?' gateways.

If the 'Regression possible?' gateway is chosen, the system proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2', where the 'Book the entrance' task is completed. This is followed by the 'Dispense process of collection' task at 'EventBasedGateway4', which eventually leads to the 'Process completed' task.

On the other hand, if the 'Opposition justified?' gateway is selected, the system moves to 'ExclusiveGateway3', where the 'VN contradicts' task is executed. This task can also lead to the 'Open' gateway, which is a fallback option.

In the case of a 'Cash receipt' event, the system completes the 'Process completed' task, marking the end of the process.

Overall, the system handles the potential regression by coordinating various tasks and gateways to ensure a smooth and efficient process.
