 The process begins with the 'What should be sent' event, which triggers the 'InclusiveGateway3' to handle the incoming request. This gateway then passes the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'InclusiveGateway2' for further processing. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Quantity' and 'ParallelGateway5' inputs, and subsequently sends the goods for collection. Meanwhile, the 'InclusiveGateway2' handles the 'Explanation' and sends it to 'InclusiveGateway3' and 'InclusiveGateway3' again. The 'InclusiveGateway3' then processes the 'Explanation' and 'Quantity' inputs, and finally, the 'Goods are shipped' event is triggered, marking the end of the process.

Here's a more natural flow description:

1. The process starts with the 'What should be sent' event, which triggers the 'InclusiveGateway3'.
2. 'InclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Explanation' and 'Quantity' inputs, and sends them to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'InclusiveGateway3' respectively.
3. 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Quantity' and 'ParallelGateway5' inputs, and sends the goods for collection.
4. 'InclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Explanation' input and sends it to 'InclusiveGateway3' and 'InclusiveGateway3' again.
5. 'InclusiveGateway3' processes the 'Explanation' and 'Quantity' inputs.
6. The 'Goods are shipped' event is triggered, marking the end of the process.
