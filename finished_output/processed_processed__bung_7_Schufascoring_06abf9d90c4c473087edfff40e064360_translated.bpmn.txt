 In the process of handling a Schufa request, the system initiates a sequence of tasks and interactions between various components. The journey begins with a Schufa request, which triggers a 'forward delay message' to the EventBasedGateway2. This message is essential for managing the timing of subsequent operations.

Simultaneously, a 'Scoring request' is processed, leading to the initiation of Level 1 Scoring through ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway is responsible for the initial scoring process, which is crucial for determining the outcome of the request.

Parallel to the Level 1 Scoring, the 'Scoring request' also triggers Level 2 Scoring through ExclusiveGateway1. This additional level of scoring provides a more detailed analysis of the request, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation.

As the Level 1 Scoring concludes, the 'Scoring results' are generated and sent to EndEvent0. This event signifies the completion of the initial scoring process and the readiness of the results for further processing.

Meanwhile, the 'forward delay message' from the Schufa request reaches the EventBasedGateway2, which then forwards the message to EndEvent0. This delay notification is essential for managing the timing of subsequent operations and ensuring a smooth flow of the process.

The 'Scoring results' are also received by EndEvent0, indicating the completion of the scoring process and the availability of the results for further processing.

In summary, the system handles a Schufa request by initiating a sequence of tasks and interactions between various components. The request triggers a 'forward delay message' and a 'Scoring request,' leading to Level 1 and Level 2 Scoring through ExclusiveGateway1. The 'Scoring results' are generated and sent to EndEvent0, while the 'forward delay message' and 'delay notification' are managed by EventBasedGateway2 and EndEvent0, respectively. This coordinated flow ensures a seamless and efficient processing of the Schufa request.
