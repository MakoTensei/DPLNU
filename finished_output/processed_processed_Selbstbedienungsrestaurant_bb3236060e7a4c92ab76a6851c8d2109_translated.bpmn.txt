 A person feeling hungry triggers the process to visit a restaurant. This process starts with the 'Feeling hungry' event, which leads to the 'Add your order' task. The person then selects a court, initiating the 'Select a court' task. This task sends a buzzer signal, indicating the readiness to receive the order.

Upon receiving the order, the restaurant prepares the food, which is then served to the person. The process also involves recording the event, capturing the guest's information, and preparing the court for the case.

Simultaneously, the court staff is alerted and ready to serve the order. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event, marking the completion of the order and the court's readiness.

In summary, the process flows as follows:

1. The person feels hungry, triggering the 'Feeling hungry' event.
