 In the scoring process, a request for scoring is initiated by the 'Schufascoring\nRequest' event, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various components and gateways.

First, the 'Schufascoring\nRequest' event sends a message to 'EventBasedGateway3', which then forwards the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway waits for a 'Score definitely?' message from 'Score definitely?', which is sent by 'Request\nReport'. Upon receiving the 'Score definitely?' message, 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends a 'Definititiver\nScore\nforward' message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway0' waits for a 'Score lvl1' message from 'waiting for\nScore lvl1', which is sent by 'waiting for\ndelay'. Once the 'Score lvl1' message arrives, 'ExclusiveGateway0' sends a 'Score definitely?' message to 'Score definitely?', which is then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

At the same time, 'Score definitely?' sends a 'Submitting delay' message to 'Submitting delay', which waits for a 'Score definitely?' message from 'Score definitely?'. Once the 'Score definitely?' message arrives, 'Submitting delay' sends a 'EndEvent1' message to 'EndEvent1'.

After receiving the 'EndEvent1' message, 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends a 'Score definitely?' message to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then forwards the message to 'EndEvent0'. Finally, 'EndEvent0' sends a 'Score' message to 'Score', which completes the scoring process.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of tasks and interactions between various components and gateways, starting with the 'Schufascoring\nRequest' event and ending with the 'Score' message being sent to 'Score'.
