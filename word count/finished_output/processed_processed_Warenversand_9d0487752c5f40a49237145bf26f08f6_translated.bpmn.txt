 In a bustling warehouse, the process of shipping goods begins with the'my start' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers for 3 shipping companies' task. This task is then passed to 'ParallelGateway3', which receives the incoming task and sends it to 'Big crowd?\n' gateway. The 'Big crowd?\n' gateway, in turn, sends the task to 'ParallelGateway4', which is responsible for 'Order Spediteuer'.

Once 'Order Spediteuer' is completed, the task is sent to 'ParallelGateway4' again, which then sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway receives the task and sends it to 'Filling the package note', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

After the goods are packaged, the task is sent back to 'ParallelGateway4', which then sends it to 'EndEvent0'. This marks the completion of the shipping process.

In case insurance is required, the'my start' event triggers the 'Complete insurance' task, which is passed to 'ParallelGateway4'. The task is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which sends it to 'ParallelGateway4' again, and the process continues until the task reaches 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the shipping process involves several tasks and gateways, including 'Pick up offers for 3 shipping companies', 'Order Spediteuer', 'Filling the package note', and 'Complete insurance'. The process is managed by 'ParallelGateway3', 'ParallelGateway4', and 'ExclusiveGateway2', with 'EndEvent0' marking the completion of the shipping process.
