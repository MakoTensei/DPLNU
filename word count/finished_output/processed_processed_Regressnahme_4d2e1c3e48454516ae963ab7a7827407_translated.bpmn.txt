 Let's walk through the process flow for handling a possible regression for VN:

1. A possible regression for VN is identified, triggering the 'possible\nRegression\nfor VN' start event.
2. The 'Payment on\nsend request to VN' task is initiated to address the potential regression.
3. The 'Process for recovery\nwand' task is triggered to handle the recovery process.
4. The 'Time period\nReimbursement\nDate of expiry' task is initiated to determine the reimbursement period and expiry date.
5. The 'Regression possibility\nis there?' gateway is checked, and if there is a possibility of regression, the 'Case closed' task is triggered.
6. If the 'Regression possibility\nis there?' gateways determines that there is no justification for opposition, the 'Case closed' task is triggered.
7. If the 'Regression possibility\nis there?' gateways determines that there is justification for opposition, the 'Objection\nVN arrived' task is triggered, followed by the 'Case closed' task.
8. If the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task is triggered, it can lead to either 'Objection\nVN arrived' or 'Cash receipt from the VN\narrived' tasks, both of which can result in the 'Case closed' task.
9. Finally, the 'Case closed' task is triggered, marking the end of the process.
