 The process begins with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Check the case' task. This task checks if the regression possibility is right and, if so, proceeds to the 'Regression procedure\nRight?' event.

If the regression possibility is confirmed, the 'Regression procedure\nRight?' event leads to the 'Send a message' task, which sets the process to WV. This task then connects to the 'Regression procedure\nhand over' event, which is triggered by the 'WV-Frist expired' event.

If the regression possibility is not confirmed, the 'Regression procedure\nRight?' event leads to the 'Close' task, which closes the case.

The 'Regression procedure\nhand over' event connects to the 'Transfer process to debt collection' task, which transfers the process to debt collection.

The 'Regression procedure\nsuccessful\ncompleted' event is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway3' event, which signifies a successful regression procedure. This event leads to the 'Book money receipt' task, which closes the case.

The 'Regression procedure\nunsuccessful\nclosed' event is also triggered by the 'Regression possibility\nRight?' event, but in this case, the case is closed due to an unsuccessful regression procedure.

The 'Regression procedure\nhand over' event is also triggered by the 'WV-Frist expired' event, which signifies that the WV has expired and the process needs to be transferred to debt collection.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which can lead to either a successful or unsuccessful regression procedure. If successful, the case is closed and the process is transferred to debt collection. If unsuccessful, the case is closed and the process is also transferred to debt collection.
