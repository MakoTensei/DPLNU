 When the 'Button\Schufascoring' is pressed, it triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' which then directs the flow to either 'Evaluate Schufa feedback' or 'Level 1 scoring feasible?' depending on the incoming events. If 'Level 1 scoring feasible?' is triggered, it leads to 'Level 1 score reported' or 'Level score reported'. Conversely, if 'Evaluate Schufa feedback' is triggered, it results in a 'Page not found' event.

Simultaneously, when a 'Scoring request' is obtained, it leads to the 'Level 1 score report' event. Additionally, the 'Get Level 2 scores' button initiates the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.

In summary, the system starts with the 'Button\Schufascoring' event, which branches off to either 'Evaluate Schufa feedback' or 'Level 1 scoring feasible?' based on the incoming events. The 'Level 1 scoring feasible?' event further branches off to 'Level 1 score reported' or 'Level score reported'. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' event leads to the 'Level 1 score report' event, and the 'Get Level 2 scores' button triggers the 'forwarding results to Frontend' process.
