 In a bustling warehouse, a series of tasks are carried out to ensure the smooth processing of orders. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'ParallelGateway3'. This gateway is responsible for initiating the 'fill out standard package tickets' task, which is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Once the package tickets are filled out, the task is forwarded to 'ParallelGateway6', where it is processed and sent to 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway3' also sends the goods for packaging, which is handled by 'ParallelGateway6' as well.

Meanwhile, customers are presented with a selection of offers, and they proceed to the 'Create a quote' task. This task is routed to 'ParallelGateway5', which then sends the quote to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Insurance close is another crucial task in the process. When a customer opts for insurance, the 'Insurance close' task is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then routes the task to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the warehouse's order processing system involves a series of tasks and gateways that work together to ensure that orders are filled, packaged, and shipped efficiently. The system starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'ParallelGateway3'. From there, tasks such as 'fill out standard package tickets', 'Create a quote', and 'Insurance close' are processed through various gateways, ultimately leading to 'EndEvent0'.
