 Upon receiving an entrance order for shipping, the process begins with the 'Entrance order for\nShipping\n' event, which triggers the initiation of Spedition 2 through ParallelGateway6. This sets off a series of tasks:

1. **Spedition 2**: This task involves filling the package note, which is then sent to ExclusiveGateway1.

2. **Choose the cheapest offer**: After the package note is filled, the task of selecting the most cost-effective offer is initiated, which requires ExclusiveGateway6.

3. **Send mail**: Once the cheapest offer is chosen, the process concludes with sending the mail, which is directed to ExclusiveGateway4.

Throughout this process, the incoming and outgoing connections between tasks and gateways are as follows:

- **Spedition 2**:
  - Incoming: Entrance order for Shipping
  - Outgoing: ExclusiveGateway1

- **Choose the cheapest offer**:
  - Incoming: ParallelGateway6
  - Outgoing: ExclusiveGateway1

- **Send mail**:
  - Incoming: ParallelGateway6
  - Outgoing: ExclusiveGateway4

This flow ensures that the shipping order is processed efficiently, from filling the package note to selecting the best offer and finally sending the mail.
