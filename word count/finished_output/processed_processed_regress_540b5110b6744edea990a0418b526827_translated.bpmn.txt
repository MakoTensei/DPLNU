 The process begins with the 'Check regression' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request to VN' task. This task is dependent on the 'Check regression' event and has 'ExclusiveGateway5' as its outgoing gateway.

Next, the 'EventBasedGateway6' event is triggered, which can lead to either 'ExclusiveGateway4' or 'Complete the process' tasks. The 'ExclusiveGateway4' task is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway6' event and has 'ExclusiveGateway5' as its outgoing gateway.

The 'ExclusiveGateway5' gateway is a common outgoing gateway for several tasks, including 'Check the procedure', 'Disclosure of debt collection', 'Reimbursement', and 'Payment received?'. These tasks are triggered by various incoming events such as 'Check regression', 'Notification', and 'Date of expiry'.

The 'Complete the process' task is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway6' event and has 'EndEvent0' as its outgoing gateway.

Finally, the process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event, which is triggered by the 'Notification' event and has no outgoing gateways.

In summary, the process starts with 'Check regression', followed by 'Send payment request to VN', and then either 'ExclusiveGateway4' or 'Complete the process'. Depending on the path taken, the process may involve tasks like 'Check the procedure', 'Disclosure of debt collection', 'Reimbursement', and 'Payment received?'. The process ends with 'EndEvent0'.
