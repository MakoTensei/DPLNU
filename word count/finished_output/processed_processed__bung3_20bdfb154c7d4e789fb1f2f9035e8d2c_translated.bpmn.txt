 The process begins with a potential regression against Vietnam (VN), which triggers a payment request to check for any reimbursement issues. This event is connected to the Regression possible? gateway, which then leads to an open state with no money.

Simultaneously, the VN payment request event is also connected to the Regression possible? gateway, which can result in a closed state with money received if the regression is not possible.

If the regression is confirmed, the process moves to the Inkasso Head of Service, which is triggered by the EventBasedGateway4. This event results in an open state with no money.

If the regression is not confirmed, the process moves to the ExclusiveGateway2, which is triggered by the EventBasedGateway4. This event leads to a closed state with money received.

The process concludes with a closed state, either with money received or no money, depending on the outcome of the regression check.
