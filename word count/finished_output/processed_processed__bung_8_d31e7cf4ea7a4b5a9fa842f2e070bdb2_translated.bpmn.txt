 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and understandable way:

1. A customer experiences hunger, triggering the 'Hunger' event.
2. The customer places an order, initiating the 'Order' event.
3. The customer selects the 'Court of Justice' to handle their order.
4. The 'Court of Justice' processes the order and sends a notification to 'Pieper' to prepare the food.
5. 'Pieper' prepares the food and notifies the customer that it's ready.
6. The customer receives the notification and is ready to eat.
7. The 'Court of Justice' instructs 'Pieper' to serve the food.
8. 'Pieper' serves the food to the customer.
9. The customer receives the food and is satisfied.
10. The 'Court of Justice' processes the order and completes it.

This flow of events can be represented in a more structured format as follows:

Start Events:
- Hunger: Customer experiences hunger.
- Order: Customer places an order.
- Court of Justice: Customer selects the court to handle their order.
