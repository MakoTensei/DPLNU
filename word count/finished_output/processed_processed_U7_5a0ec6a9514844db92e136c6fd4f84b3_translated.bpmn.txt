 When a scoring request is initiated, the system first checks if there is a need to delay the scoring process by routing the request to the 'Scoring Delayed?' gateway. This gateway, identified by'sid-EE8410E3-F374-4C50-B4FB-DF10B4FBC986', will either send the scoring request back for further processing or inform the scoring system about the delay.

If the scoring process is not delayed, the system proceeds to the 'Determining scoring (level 1)' gateway,'sid-C4FF567D-EA4D-4F01-8A2D-44EAD9CF794C', which will then forward the request to the 'Determining scoring (level 2)' gateway,'sid-1AFA9AFD-9EA5-4040-B420-E60A11BE1CAE'. This gateway will send the scoring request to the 'Send Scoring' gateway,'sid-FF089449-8F27-45E5-A37A-D4034927A250', which will ultimately send the scoring request to the scoring system.

In the case of a scoring request with a report, the system will route the request to the 'EventBasedGateway1','sid-73AC45F8-30E0-416D-BF4F-0B08BD492C8A', which will forward the request to the 'Scoring' gateway,'sid-C29F977A-5EA0-4661-A0C2-7417C870CEE1', and then to the 'Send Scoring' gateway,'sid-A3D0C3E0-C3C0-41B9-BE9A-49DAB30751D6'.

If a scoring request is accompanied by a report, the system will also send an 'Information about waiting time' notification to the 'SB inform' gateway,'sid-8
