 In a bustling financial services company, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure smooth operations. When a 'Regress determined' event occurs, it triggers the 'Checking' task, which then sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If a 'Regress determined' event is also accompanied by a 'Reimbursement period expired' event, the 'Checking' task sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway2' as well.

Simultaneously, the 'Regress determined' event also initiates the 'Send payment request to VN' task, which sends a request to 'Payment received' and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.

When a 'Payment received' event occurs, it triggers the 'Book payment receipt' task, which sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.

The 'Complete the process' task is triggered by the 'Objection
