 The process begins with a 'Regression possibility submitted' event, which triggers a 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to inquire about the possibility of a regression. If the possibility is given, the process moves to the 'Set process to WV' task, which is dependent on the 'Opposition arrived' event. If the process is set to WV, it then proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task.

If the 'Opposition arrived' event occurs, the process is directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which leads to the 'Process unsuccessful completed' task. This indicates that the process was unsuccessful due to opposition.

Alternatively, if the 'possibility given?' event occurs, the process moves to the 'justified?' task, which is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway4' event. If the process is justified, it proceeds to the 'Process successful completed' task, indicating a successful completion of the process.

In the case of successful completion, the process is forwarded to the 'Inkasso-DL' for debt collection.

If the 'possibility given?' event does not occur, the process moves to the 'Reimbursement period expired' event, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task. This task results in the 'Process in debt collection forwarded' task, indicating that the process is forwarded for debt collection due to an expired reimbursement period.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Regression possibility submitted' event, which can lead to different outcomes based on the incoming events and their dependencies. The process can either be successful, unsuccessful, or forwarded for debt collection, depending on the events and gateways involved.
