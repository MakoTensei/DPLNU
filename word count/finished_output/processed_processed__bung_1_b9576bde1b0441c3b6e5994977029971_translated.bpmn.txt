 In the logistics process, a special shipment initiates at ParallelGateway4, which then leads to the Filling standard package voucher task. This task is followed by a decision point where the necessity of insurance is evaluated. If insurance is deemed necessary, the process diverges to ParallelGateway5, where insurance is closed by the logistics manager. Concurrently, goods are packaged for warehouse workers' collection.


Meanwhile, the special shipment also triggers ParallelGateway2, which in turn leads to three instances of ParallelGateway3, each responsible for different tasks. One of these tasks is the appointment of forwarding, which concludes the process at EndEvent0.


Additionally, the start of the process is marked by StartEvent0, which initiates the filling of standard package vouchers. The process concludes at EndEvent0, where the special shipment is finalized.
