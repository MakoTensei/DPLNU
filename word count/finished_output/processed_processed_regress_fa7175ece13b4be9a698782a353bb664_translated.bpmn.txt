 When a case is flagged as "VN must be in Regress," the system initiates a sequence of events to handle the situation. First, a message is sent to notify the relevant parties that the case is in regress. This message triggers an outgoing event to "Set on re-submission," which is dependent on the incoming event "Regress?" from the Regress? Gateway.

Upon receiving the "Set on re-submission" event, the system proceeds to book the entrance for the case, which is an outgoing event to "ExclusiveGateway3." This action is dependent on the incoming event "Money received," which is triggered by the "Set on re-submission" event.

Once the case is booked, the system checks the case by sending an event to "ExclusiveGateway3." This event is dependent on the incoming event "VN must be in Regress." If the case is confirmed to be in regress, the system then sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway2," which is dependent on the incoming event "Regress?" from the Regress? Gateway.

At "ExclusiveGateway2," the system examines the case and sends an event to "EndEvent0." This event is dependent on the incoming events "EventBasedGateway4" and "Examination."

If the case is not in regress, the system sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway3," which is dependent on the incoming event "Right?" from the Right? Gateway. This event is also dependent on the outgoing event "Regress?" from the Regress? Gateway.

Finally, the system closes the process by sending an event to "EndEvent0." This event is dependent on the incoming event "Money received," which is triggered by the "Set on re-submission" event.

In summary, when a case is flagged as "VN must be in Regress," the system follows a sequence of events to handle the situation, involving multiple gateways and outgoing events, ultimately leading to the closure of the process.
