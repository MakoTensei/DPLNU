This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Separation of shipment quantity/size' task. The 'Separation of shipment quantity/size' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which further leads to the 'Check the insurance requirement' task.

The 'Check the insurance requirement' task is connected to the 'Insurance necessary?' event, which then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which finally leads to the 'Good quality' event.
