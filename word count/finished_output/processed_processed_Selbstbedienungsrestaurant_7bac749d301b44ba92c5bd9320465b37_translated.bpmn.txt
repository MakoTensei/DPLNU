 A person feels hungry and decides to enter a restaurant. They wait in line and eventually place an order. The order is processed, and the pieper (a server or food handler) adjusts the order based on the customer's preferences. The pieper then hands off the order to the kitchen staff to prepare the meals. Once the meals are ready, the pieper triggers the process to serve the customer. The customer receives their meal and enjoys the service.

In the background, an intermediate event called "IntermediateCatchEvent0" captures the hunger feeling, and a start event called "StartEvent1" initiates the process of meal handling. The order is obtained, and the meals are prepared and ready to be served.

After the meal is served, the process ends with two events: "Meals\ninsulated" and "Customer\nservice." The insulated meals are stored for later use, and the customer receives the service they requested. The process concludes with "EndEvent2," marking the completion of the meal handling and serving process.
