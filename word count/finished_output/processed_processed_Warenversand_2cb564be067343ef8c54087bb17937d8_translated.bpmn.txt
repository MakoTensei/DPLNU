 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to handle incoming tasks such as 'Auditing' and 'Filling the package note'. The 'Auditing' task, in turn, leads to the 'Big crowd?' gateway, which then directs the 'Specialist' to handle the task. The 'Filling the package note' task, on the other hand, goes through the 'clarified' gateway, resulting in the 'Goods are sent' event.

Meanwhile, 'Packaging goods' task is also directed to 'ParallelGateway4', which then sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which finally leads to the 'Goods are sent' event.

The 'Best offer of 3 carriers' task is also directed to 'Big crowd?', which sends it to the 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then connects to 'Complete insurance' task, which is triggered by the 'Close insurance?' event.

In summary, the process involves various tasks and gateways, with 'Goods are sent' being the final event in the process. The 'Shipping costs' event initiates the process, while the 'Goods are sent' event concludes it.
