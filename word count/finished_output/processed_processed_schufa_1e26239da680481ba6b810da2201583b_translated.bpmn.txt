 In the realm of financial data processing, a series of tasks unfold, each with its own purpose and connections to other tasks, gateways, and events. Let's dive into the intricate web of these operations:

1. The journey begins with the 'Requirements the Schufa Scoring' event, which triggers the transfer of scoring data to Level 1. This task is connected to the 'Transfer scoring data Level 1' task, which in turn leads to the completion of the 'Scoring request Level 1 completed' task.

2. Concurrently, the 'Requirements the Schufa Scoring' event also initiates a time loop, labeled 'Time loop X seconds'. This loop is designed to repeat a specific task, which is the 'Scoring request Level 1 completed' task, until a certain condition is met.

3. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request send' task is set in motion, sending the 'Scoring request' message to the 'Feedback Scoring Level 1' gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends back the 'Scoring request completed' message, signaling the successful completion of the task.

4. The 'Scoring request Level 1' task is also triggered, which sends the 'Scoring request' message to the 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway then sends back two 'Scoring request Level 1 completed' messages, indicating that the task has been completed.

5. The 'Scoring request Level 1' task also connects to the 'Delay Information' task, which is activated when the 'Scoring request Level 1' task is not timely feasible. This task sends a 'Feedback Scoring Level 1 not timely feasible' message to the 'Delay Information' gateway, which in turn sends back a 'Delay Information' message.

6. The 'Scoring request Conduct Level 2' task is initiated, sending the 'Scoring request' message to the 'Scoring request Level 2 completed' gateway. This gateway then sends back a 'Scoring request Level 2 completed' message, signaling the successful completion of the task.

7. The 'Scoring request Level 2' task is also connected to the '
