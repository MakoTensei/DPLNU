 In the system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Schufascoring inquiries' task. This task is designed to handle queries related to Schufa scoring. Once the task is completed, it sends the results to'sid-14F3F2B8-4A8A-4F45-8552-69E0BFA46887'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Get Level1 results' task. This task is responsible for retrieving the Level 1 scoring results. The results are then sent to'sid-9109966B-99ED-4942-8BB5-145D357B9A42'.

If the Level 1 results are not available, the 'Message Level1 not available' event triggers the 'Scoring Level2' task. This task is designed to handle the scoring when Level 1 results are not available. The results are then sent to'sid-69329D4C-0765-47D9-9353-28D9B3F81958'.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent1' also triggers the 'Scoring request Level 1\nDebt' task. This task is responsible for handling requests related to Level 1 scoring and debt. The results are sent to'sid-69329D4C-0765-47D9-9353-28D9B3F81958'.

The 'Determining Level 2 scoring' task is initiated when the Level 1 results are not available. This task is responsible for determining the Level 2 scoring. The results are then sent to'sid-69329D4C-0765-47D9-9353-28D9B3F81958'.

The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', 'EndEvent2', and 'EndEvent3' events, which mark the completion of the respective tasks.
