 In a system designed to handle financial scoring requests and results, the following sequence of events and gateways are involved:

1. The process begins with the 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway forwards the request to the 'forward level2 results to frontend' task, which sends the results to the frontend.

2. The 'Schufa request\nReport' event triggers the 'forward delay' gateway. This gateway delays the process and forwards the request to the 'Determining Final Scoring Results (Level2)' task.

3. The 'Results are available?' gateway receives the 'Schufa request\nReport' event and forwards the results to the'sid-93D5F8FD-B1FA-4941-BA67-3BC0153E9A13' task and the 'forward delay' gateway.

4. The 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event triggers the 'forward delay' gateway, which forwards the request to the 'Delay' task.

5. The 'Results received' gateway receives the 'Schufa.\nRequest\nsend' event and forwards the results to the 'EndEvent0' task.

6. The 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest is\nReport' event triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1', which forwards the request to the 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' tasks.

7. The 'Results Level2 pardon' event triggers the 'EndEvent1' task.

8. The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' tasks are the final events in the process, with no incoming or outgoing connections.

This flow ensures that the financial scoring request is processed, results are determined, and the final results are delivered to the frontend.
