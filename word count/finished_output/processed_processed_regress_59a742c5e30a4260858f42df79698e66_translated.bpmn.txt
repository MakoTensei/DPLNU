 The workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Regression consists of:' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Money received' event, which in turn triggers the 'Book money receipt' task. Following this, the 'EndEvent0' is reached, marking the completion of the regression check.

Next, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' is triggered, leading to the 'Denial of payment justified Check' gateway. This gateway sends a 'Debt collection' event and an 'EndEvent2' event, indicating the completion of the debt collection process.

The 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' which sends a 'Money received' event and an 'EndEvent2' event, signifying the end of the exclusive gateway process.

Lastly, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Objection' task, which sends a 'Denial of payment justified Check' event, leading to the 'EndEvent0' and marking the completion of the objection process.
