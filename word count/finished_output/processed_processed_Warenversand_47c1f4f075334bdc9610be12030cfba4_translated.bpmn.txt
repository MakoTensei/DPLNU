 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then directs the flow to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. From 'ExclusiveGateway2', the process diverges into two paths: one leading to 'ParallelGateway4' and the other to 'Insurance?'. The 'Insurance?' gateway further splits into 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway0' also sends the flow to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn leads to 'ParallelGateway6'. 'ParallelGateway6' receives inputs from 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway4', and finally directs the flow to 'Provide for collection'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' pathway, on the other hand, leads to 'EndEvent0', marking the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', which initiates the creation of an offer. The offer is then picked up and a shipping method is decided. The package note is filled, and the offer is shipped by freight forwarders. The process concludes with providing for collection.
