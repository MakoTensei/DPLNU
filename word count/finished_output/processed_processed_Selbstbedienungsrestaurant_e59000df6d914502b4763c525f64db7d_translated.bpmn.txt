 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and descriptive way, fitting them into a single paragraph:

1. A customer visits the restaurant, triggering the event "Visit the restaurant." This event leads to the next step, "Pick up meal," where the customer selects their desired meal.

2. The customer places an order at the restaurant, which is captured by the event "Order received." This event connects to the "Hand over meal" step, where the kitchen prepares the meal based on the order.

3. The order is received by the restaurant's system, initiating the event "Order to receive." This event links to the "sid-4673BB47-CDAA-42C1-8C37-12C735ACF046" process, which likely involves the kitchen receiving the order and preparing the meal.

4. Once the meal is ready, the kitchen sends the order to the "Send order to kitchen" event, which leads to the "Pick up Pieper" step, where the kitchen staff retrieves the prepared meal.

5. The kitchen staff then hands over the meal to the customer, resulting in the "Take meal" event. The customer consumes the meal, completing the "meal completed" event.

6. Upon completion of the meal, the customer's order is processed, leading to the "Adjust Pieper" event. This event connects to the "sid-C4ED5051-34EB-43A9-B969-4E3CD4556B97" process, which likely involves adjusting the bill or payment for the meal.

7. The customer pays for the meal, triggering the "Cash" event. This event links to the "sid-F8210D15-E332-40DB-965D-AEEA1630312F" process, which likely involves processing the payment and updating the restaurant's records.

8. The restaurant informs the customer about the meal via "Pieper," leading to the "Guest collects food" event.
