 When a question is initiated, it triggers the 'Start Scoring' task, which then sends a 'StartEvent0' to the system. This event is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn directs the question to the 'Scoring Level1' task. The 'Scoring Level1' task evaluates the question and sends the results to the 'ParallelGateway1'. The 'ParallelGateway1' then sends the results to either the 'Delay' task or directly to the'receive result' task, depending on the scoring level. The'receive result' task receives the results and marks the process as finished.
