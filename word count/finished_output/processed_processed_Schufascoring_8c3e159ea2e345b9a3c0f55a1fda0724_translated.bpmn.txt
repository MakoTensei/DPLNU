 When a Schufascoring request and Report is received, it triggers the process to send an inquiry to the Schufa. This initiates a sequence of events and interactions between various tasks, gateways, and end events.

1. The Schufascoring request and Report is first received by ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway processes the incoming request and determines that the result meets the criteria. As a result, it sends the inquiry to the Schufa and directs the flow to ExclusiveGateway1.

2. ExclusiveGateway1 receives the inquiry from the Schufa and sends a notification to the bank. This notification contains the Scoring request and Report.

3. The bank receives the notification and processes the Scoring request and Report. The bank then initiates the process to send the scoring results to the bank.

4. The scoring results are sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which has two outgoing paths: 'Process completed' and 'Report delay to credit award.' In this case, the gateway sends the results to the 'Send result to credit award' task.

5. The 'Send result to credit award' task receives the scoring results and sends a notification to the bank. The bank processes the notification and completes the process.

6. The 'Process completed' event is triggered, and the bank sends a 'Process completed' notification back to ExclusiveGateway1.

7. ExclusiveGateway1 receives the 'Process completed' notification and sends the flow to the 'Process completed' event.

8. The 'Process completed' event is triggered, and the flow ends.

In summary, the process starts with a Schufascoring request and Report, which triggers a series of events and interactions between tasks, gateways, and end events. The process concludes with the bank completing the process and sending a 'Process completed' notification back to the gateways.
