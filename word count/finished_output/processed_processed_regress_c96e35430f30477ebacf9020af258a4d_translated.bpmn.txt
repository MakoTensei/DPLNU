 Let's start with the event where a 'Regression possibility Report' is generated. This report triggers a 'Send a message' task, which then leads to a 'Check the case' task. The 'Check the case' task has two possible outcomes: it can either go to 'ExclusiveGateway3' or 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the 'Check the case' task goes to 'ExclusiveGateway3', it will receive an 'EventBasedGateway4' and will close the case with a 'Process with cash receipt closed' task.

On the other hand, if the 'Check the case' task goes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', it will receive an 'EventBasedGateway4' and will forward the case to 'Case forwarded'.

Meanwhile, if the 'Regression possibility Report' goes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', it will lead to a 'Proceedings' task, which will receive an 'Opposition Report' and will close the case without a cash receipt.

Lastly, if the 'Regression possibility Report' goes to 'ExclusiveGateway3', it will receive an 'EventBasedGateway4' and will forward the case to 'Case forwarded'.

In summary, the flow of events is as follows:

1. A 'Regression possibility Report' is generated.
2. A 'Send a message' task is triggered.
3. The 'Send a message' task can either go to 'ExclusiveGateway3' or 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. If it goes to 'ExclusiveGateway3', it will receive an 'EventBasedGateway4' and close the case with a 'Process with cash receipt closed'.
5. If it goes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', it will receive an 'EventBasedGateway4' and forward the case to 'Case forwarded'.
6. If the 'Regression possibility Report' goes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', it will lead to a 'Proceedings' task, which will receive an 'Opposition Report' and close the case without a cash receipt.
