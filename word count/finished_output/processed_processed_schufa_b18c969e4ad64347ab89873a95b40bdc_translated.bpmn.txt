 When a 'Scoring triggered' event occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the scoring results. The first task, 'Send inquiry to Schufa', is triggered by the incoming 'Scoring triggered' event and awaits a 'Result?' response. Upon receiving the 'Result?', the task 'Result forward' is executed, which then sends the result to 'ParallelGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Adding result' task is triggered by the 'Scoring triggered' event and awaits a 'Result obtained' event. Once the result is obtained, the task 'Adding result' sends the result to 'ParallelGateway3'.

If the 'Result?' is not obtained, the 'Other tasks do not do so' task is executed, which does not interact with any other tasks.

When a 'Scoring requested' event occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to report the results. The first task, 'Report the result', is triggered by the incoming 'Scoring requested' event and awaits a 'Result obtained' event. Upon receiving the 'Result obtained', the task 'Report the result' sends the result to 'ParallelGateway3'.

The second task, 'Report delay', is triggered by the incoming 'Result obtained' event and awaits a 'Report the result' event. Once the report is completed, the task 'Report delay' sends the result to 'Scoring Level 2'.

Upon completion of the 'Result obtained' event, the 'Report the result' task sends the result to 'Request finished'.

In summary, the system processes scoring results by sending inquiries, adding results, and reporting results through a series of interconnected tasks and gateways.
