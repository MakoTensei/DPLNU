 The process begins with the 'Product is Ship Ready' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task. This task receives input from 'Which Type of Shipping?' gateway and sends output to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task, in turn, receives input from the same 'Which Type of Shipping?' gateway and directs output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Next, the 'Specialist' task sends output to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is triggered by the 'Filling Standard Package Voucher' and 'Insurance Necessary?' tasks. This gateway then sends output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway receives input from both 'Which Type of Shipping?' tasks and sends output to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway4' task, which receives input from the 'Product is Ship Ready' event.

Finally, the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway receives input from both 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Insurance Necessary?' tasks and sends output to the 'Goods for Collection Made Available' event, marking the end of the process.
