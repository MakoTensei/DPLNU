 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph:

When a guest feels hungry, they are directed to select a court (sid-31739E6B-ED2B-4876-CFFB-996B69C53333). Once they have chosen a court, they proceed to the restaurant (sid-89B28B72-FBC7-44DF-AE6C-AC4666666666). At the restaurant, the guest places their order (sid-0545855E-61C4-4347-98CF-88A8C5B8FF81), which triggers the process of adding the order to the cash register (sid-FE4D57F0-7091-42C9-97A7-843033333333). The guest then gives money to the cashier (sid-1C5D1636-ACA7-4827-E7EA-372FE2C7D533).

Meanwhile, the kitchen staff receives the order (sid-FE4D57F0-7091-42C9-97A7-843033333333) and prepares the food (sid-DB86C28B-6523-4A79-A0DB-4E9E693AC49C). Once the food is ready, it is handed over to the guest (sid-67E1309E-74DA-4C9E-85A1-1BB327B56968). The guest then eats the meal (sid-1210D3C8-77B3-4F9E-70D6-2FECA9B2C0FE), which leads to a decrease in their hunger (sid-694C791E-9F4C-491E-912D-EA
