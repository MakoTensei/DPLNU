 In a seamless flow of events, the process begins with the 'StartEvent1', which triggers the 'Results available?' event. This event then leads to the 'Scoring result (level 2)' task, which is dependent on the'sid-CA21B44B-419F-41A1-8A52-B0D29FEF92E9' task. The 'Scoring result (level 2)' task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway3', which connects to the 'Scoring result (level 1)' task. This task is dependent on the'sid-2E0CCAA5-557D-4F10-809F-995C7DE37840' task and leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then connects to the 'EndEvent0', completing the first scoring process.

Meanwhile, the 'EventBasedGateway3' also connects to the 'Delay' event, which leads to the'sid-4B161450-BDC9-418B-994E-9CCFDEEDE654' task. This task is independent and does not lead to any other events.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent1', leading to the 'Results available?' event, which triggers the 'Scoring result (level 2)' task. This task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway3', which connects to the 'Scoring result (level 1)' task and the 'Delay' event. The 'Delay' event leads to an independent task, completing the process.
