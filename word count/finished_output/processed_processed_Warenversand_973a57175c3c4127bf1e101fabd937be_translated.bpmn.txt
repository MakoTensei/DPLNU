 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the 'Pick up offers' task, which involves selecting the cheapest offer for shipping. This task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for handling large amounts and insurance inquiries. If the shipping involves a large amount, the process flows to 'ParallelGateway4', which is the next step in the shipping process. Once the goods are ready for collection, the process concludes at 'Goods are ready for collection', which also connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. This flow ensures that goods are shipped efficiently, with the cheapest offer selected and the necessary steps taken for large shipments and insurance considerations.
