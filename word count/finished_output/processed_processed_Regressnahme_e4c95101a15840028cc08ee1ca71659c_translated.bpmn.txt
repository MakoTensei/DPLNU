 The system processes various tasks and events, starting with a 'Regression claim' that triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then leads to a 'Case closed' event. Similarly, the 'Test' task results in a 'Case closed' event, while the 'Booking' task also concludes with a 'Case closed' event. The 'Cash receipt' task, upon receiving an incoming 'Cash receipt' event, also leads to a 'Case closed' event. The 'Opposition' task, when triggered by an 'Opposition' event, results in 'EndEvent3'. The 'EventBasedGateway2' receives incoming events from 'Regression claim', 'Test', 'Booking', and 'Cash receipt', and directs them to 'Case closed', 'EndEvent3', and 'EndEvent4' respectively. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives an incoming 'EventBasedGateway2' event and leads to a 'Case closed' event. Lastly, 'EndEvent4' is triggered by an incoming 'EventBasedGateway2' event.
