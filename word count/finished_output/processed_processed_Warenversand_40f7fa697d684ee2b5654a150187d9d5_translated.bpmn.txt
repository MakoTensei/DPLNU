 In the intricate dance of logistics orchestrated by our system, the responsibility for shipping is a pivotal role, seamlessly transitioning through various gateways and processes. Initially, when goods are identified for shipment, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event triggers the 'Get offers from forwarders' task, which is facilitated by the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway acts as a decision point, determining the path forward based on the incoming request.


The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the request to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for gathering offers from freight forwarders. The offers are evaluated, and the 'Beuaftragtet selected freight forwarders' task is initiated, which is also routed through 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task's purpose is to select the most cost-effective freight forwarder, ensuring the best value for the shipping process.


Once the best offer is chosen, the 'Chooses the cheapest offer' task is triggered, which again passes through 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is crucial as it ensures that the selected freight forwarder is indeed the most economical option.

If insurance is required, the 'Close insurance' task is activated, which is routed through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task finalizes the insurance process, ensuring that the shipment is adequately covered.
