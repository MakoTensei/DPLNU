 The process begins with the 'Regression\nreceive the test' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task. This task is then followed by the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which in turn leads to the 'Payment\nobtained' task. The 'Payment\nobtained' task then triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which eventually leads to the 'Case\ncompleted' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression\nreceive the test' event also triggers the 'Opposition\nobtained' event. This event leads to the 'Payment\nrefusal\njustified?' task, which then triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, leading to the 'Case\ncompleted' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Regression\npossible?' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which leads to the 'Payment\nrefusal\njustified?' task. This task then triggers the'sid-7E53779E-DEAC-4516-AF7C-8255EF23B6C4' task, which eventually leads to the 'Case\ncompleted' task.

Additionally, the 'Regression\npossible?' event also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway4' task, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, and subsequently to the 'Case\ncompleted' task.

Lastly, the 'Reimbursement\nDate of expiry' event triggers the 'Case\nforwarded' task, which is the final step in the process.
