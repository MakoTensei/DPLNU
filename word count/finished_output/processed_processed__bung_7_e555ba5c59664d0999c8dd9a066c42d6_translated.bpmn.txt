 In the process of handling a request, the system initiates with a 'Request request' event, which triggers the 'Return Score' gateway to process the request. The 'Return Score' gateway then sends the request to the 'Score determined?' gateway, which determines the score. Once the score is determined, the 'Request completed' event is triggered, marking the end of the process.


Here's a more natural flow description using the given names:


1. A 'Request request' event is initiated, prompting the system to send the request to the 'Return Score' gateway.

2. The 'Return Score' gateway receives the request and forwards it to the 'Score determined?' gateway.

3. The 'Score determined?' gateway processes the request and determines the score.

4. Upon determining the score, the 'Score determined?' gateway sends a 'Request completed' event to signal the end of the process.


This flow can occur multiple times as indicated by the multiple 'Request request' events, each following the same sequence of events.
