 When a scoring request is initiated, it triggers the StartEvent0, which then leads to Level 2 scoring. Once Level 2 scoring is completed, the result is redirected to EndEvent0. Concurrently, if Level 1 scoring is required, it is initiated through StartEvent1, which then checks with the Level 1 available? gateway. If Level 1 is available, the scoring process continues to EndEvent2, and if not, it redirects to EndEvent1. Meanwhile, if there is a delay in the scoring process, it is handled by the StartEvent0, which leads to the Delay event, and once the delay is resolved, the result is redirected to EndEvent0.
