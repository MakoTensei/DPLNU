 The process begins with the 'Regression case mgl. before' task, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task. This task is followed by the 'Add to wishlist' task, which in turn leads to the 'Money received' task. The 'Money received' task then triggers the 'Book the entrance' task. After the 'Book the entrance' task, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task is initiated, which subsequently leads to the 'Denial of payment justified?' task. This task triggers the 'Close' task, marking the completion of the regression process.

In parallel, the 'Regression case mgl. before' task also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway4' task. This task leads to the 'VN Report' task, which then triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task is also triggered by the 'Denial of payment justified?' task, which in turn leads to the 'Close' task.

The 'EventBasedGateway4' task also triggers the 'Inkasso handed over' task, which then leads back to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task.

In summary, the process starts with a regression case and ends with the completion of the regression process. The process also involves various tasks and gateways, such as sending payment requests, adding items to the wishlist, receiving money, booking an entrance, and handling denial of payment.
