 In the shipping process, the workflow begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' start event, which triggers the 'Insurance required?' gateway, leading to the 'Insurance close' task. This task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway3'. Concurrently, the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event also initiates the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which connects to 'ParallelGateway3'.

Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway2' gateway receives the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event and sends it to both 'Insurance required?' and 'Fill in a Pact Paper for Postal Shipping' gateways. The 'Fill in a Pact Paper for Postal Shipping' gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'ParallelGateway2', triggers the 'Pick up 3 special delivery offers' and 'Fill in a Pact Paper for Postal Shipping' tasks, both of which connect to 'ParallelGateway3'.

The 'Selection of an offer' task, which has an incoming connection from 'ExclusiveGateway0', connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. Similarly, the 'Selected offer' task, also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0', connects to 'ParallelGateway3'.

The 'Clearing the shipping mode' task, triggered by the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, connects to the 'Insurance required?' gateway, which in turn connects to 'ParallelGateway3'.

Lastly, the 'Packaging goods' task, with an incoming connection from 'ParallelGateway2', connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Provide goods for collection' task, triggered by 'ParallelGateway3', connects to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the workflow involves various tasks and gateways, with 'ParallelGateway3' serving as a central hub for multiple incoming and outgoing connections, ensuring a smooth and efficient shipping process.
