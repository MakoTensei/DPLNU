 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Report delay' task, which is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0'. This task is responsible for handling any delays in the scoring process.

Once the 'Scoring request' task is initiated, it triggers the 'forward scoring result' task, which is also managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0'. This task is responsible for forwarding the results of the scoring process.

The 'Scoring request' task also triggers the 'Scoring completed' task, which in turn triggers the 'EndEvent2'. This task is responsible for completing the scoring process and signaling the end of the scoring phase.

The 'Scoring delays' task, triggered by the 'StartEvent0', leads to the'second scoring perform' task, which is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0'. This task handles any delays in the scoring process and signals the start of the second scoring phase.

The'second scoring perform' task triggers the 'final scoring lies ahead' task, which is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0'. This task indicates that the final scoring phase is about to begin.

Finally, the 'final scoring lies ahead' task triggers the 'EndEvent3', signaling the end of the scoring process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Report delay' task, followed by the 'Scoring request' task initiating the scoring process. The 'Scoring completed' task signals the end of the scoring phase, and the 'final scoring lies ahead' task indicates the start of the final scoring phase. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent3' signaling the end of the scoring process.
