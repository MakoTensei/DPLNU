 In the financial services system, a process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Schufa request' task, leading to a 'Calculation result'. This result then flows into the 'EventBasedGateway1', where it is further processed to produce a 'Final result'. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Scoring Level 1' task, which concludes with a 'Calculation completed' event. This event feeds into the 'Result' gateway, which in turn delivers the 'Final result'. Additionally, the 'perform scoring level 2' task, originating from 'Schufa request', completes its calculation and also contributes to the 'Calculation completed' event, which is essential for the 'Final result'. Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also leads to the 'Endurance does not exist' event, which is a separate pathway in the system.
