 The system initiates a process with StartEvent0, which leads to the Schufa Level 2 task (sid-78C4AD2E-2985-4BAD-9150-6E62BFA9F470) that answers the Schufa inquiry. This task is triggered by StartEvent1 and concludes with the Schufa answer (sid-84F7D77A-DF4B-4EC2-A930-9D224BDE7294).

Simultaneously, two separate StartEvents (StartEvent2 and StartEvent3) initiate the Run scoring request tasks (sid-084844A5-7EC0-4A87-ACFA-96EB87D7E0BC and sid-22D610C2-9C3E-4B6B-8943-2E5DAF27C969) respectively. Both tasks are connected to their respective answers (sid-66DDE5B7-B0BD-432E-A417-36012608E9F0 and sid-BC9EC191-4295-4359-8D30-771DD9AFBFDA).

The system also includes an Answer Schufa gateway (sid-7352CE8F-A146-4B03-ACD9-4E59F66B3F1C) that receives the Schufa Level 2 task and sends the response to sid-9C70CF2E-7913-43F2-87CD-455FA40D6DCD.

In summary, the system processes Schufa inquiries and scoring requests through a series of interconnected tasks, gateways, and events, ensuring a seamless flow of information and responses.
