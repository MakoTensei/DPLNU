 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Information?' gateway, which then sends the inquiry to Schufa and directs the flow to 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Scoring Level 1\nDebt' process, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway determines the scoring level 2 and sends a report to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. 'ExclusiveGateway1' then concludes the process by sending 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, 'StartEvent0' also sends the inquiry to 'InclusiveGateway3', which in turn sends the inquiry to 'Scoring Level 2'. The 'Scoring Level 2' process is then followed by 'Scoring Level 1\nDebt' and 'Send scoring inquiry to Schufa' processes, which are both directed to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event ultimately leads to 'EndEvent0'.
