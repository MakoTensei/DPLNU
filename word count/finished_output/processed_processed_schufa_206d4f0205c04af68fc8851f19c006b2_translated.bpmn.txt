 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'give the frontend the delay' task. This task is connected to the 'Result\nis fixed' task, which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent0'. 

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'is Ergbnis stuck?' task, which has two outcomes. If the result is 'not fixed', it triggers the 'give the frontend the delay' task. If the result is 'fixed', it leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'StartEvent1' triggers the 'perform a Level 1 scoring and decide whether a result already exists' task. If the result is 'fixed', it leads to the 'EndEvent2'. If the result is 'not fixed', it triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, which eventually leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task is connected to the'sid-925BE5BE-5D84-49CB-BC27-5D0B50F83D93' task, which in turn leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

The'sid-92DF0EF6-B094-432C-9980-BC51C3D7CF23' task initiates the'start a scoring\nRequest' task, which is connected to the 'Result\nis fixed' task. If the result is 'fixed', it leads to the 'EndEvent0'. If the result is 'not fixed', it triggers the 'Result\nnot fixed' task, which eventually leads to the 'give the frontend the delay' task.

The'sid-2AB715C9-0011-4E74-BFD8-3E695A22A230' task initiates the'send scoring results' task, which is connected to the 'EndEvent0'.

The'sid-3FAC7DA0-EB54-43F1-8E9A-A214AB7F6A8F' task initiates the 'give the frontend the delay' task, which is connected to
