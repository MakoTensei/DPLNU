 In the process of packaging goods, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, managed by 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is then followed by the 'Packaging goods' task, which is also initiated by 'StartEvent0' and is directed towards 'ParallelGateway5'. After the goods are packaged, the 'Provision for collection' task is executed, which is initiated by 'StartEvent0' and concludes with 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, the 'Insurance' task, which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4', also ends with 'EndEvent0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' is the common outgoing point for both the 'Provision for collection' and 'EndEvent0' tasks, ensuring a smooth transition in the workflow.
