 In the process of handling a VN payment request, the system initiates an examination of the process, which can be triggered by a report on possible regression against VN. This examination leads to a procedure for resubmission, which is communicated to the customer. The customer's response to the resubmission procedure is then directed to ExclusiveGateway3.

If the customer objects to the VN, the system routes the message to ExclusiveGateway2, which in turn sends the process to the debt collection service provider. Conversely, if the customer does not object, the system proceeds to ExclusiveGateway4, where the process is delivered to the debt collection service provider.

During the process, the system also handles incoming cash receipts and examines the process for any potential regression against VN. If a regression is detected, the system closes the process.

In summary, the system manages the VN payment request by examining the process, handling customer objections, and coordinating with the debt collection service provider. The process is closed when a regression against VN is reported.
