 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Type of shipping' task, where the 'InclusiveGateway2' is responsible for handling the incoming 'Shipping goods' and outgoing 'Quantity'. Following this, the 'ParallelGateway3' receives the 'Shipping goods' and sends out 'Request offers\n' to the 'Select a quote' task, which is also connected to 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'Select a quote' task, upon receiving 'large amount?', triggers the 'Insurance funds?' task, which in turn sends 'Insurance funds?' to 'InclusiveGateway2' and 'Goods are ready for collection'. Concurrently, the 'Warehouse workers packaged' task, also linked to 'InclusiveGateway2', handles the 'ParallelGateway3' input and outputs 'Warehouse workers provide goods for collection'. The 'Insurance funds?' task, upon receiving 'Insurance funds?', sends 'Insurance funds?' to 'InclusiveGateway2' and 'Goods are ready for collection'. Finally, the 'Goods are ready for collection' event concludes the process, with 'Insurance funds?' as its incoming and no outgoing tasks.
