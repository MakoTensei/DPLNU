 The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent', which triggers the task 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers'. This task receives incoming messages from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends out an offer selection prompt to the user. Once the user selects an offer, the task 'Select your offer' is initiated, which receives a prompt about the possibility of a 'Large Lot?' and sends out an offer selection prompt.

If the user confirms the 'Large Lot?', the task 'Select the Spediteur' is triggered, which receives the confirmation and sends out a prompt to select a shipping service. The selected shipping service, 'ExclusiveGateway1', then triggers the task 'Provide goods for collection', which receives the confirmation and sends out a message to make the goods available.

If the user confirms the necessity of insurance, the task 'Clearing shipping and insurance' is triggered, which receives the confirmation and sends out a prompt to complete the insurance. The completed insurance task, 'Complete insurance', then triggers the task 'Filling the message', which receives the confirmation and sends out a message to fill the shipping and insurance details.

The 'Filling the message' task then triggers the 'ParallelGateway5', which receives the message and sends out a message to make the goods available. Finally, the 'product made available' event is triggered, which receives the confirmation and ends the process.
