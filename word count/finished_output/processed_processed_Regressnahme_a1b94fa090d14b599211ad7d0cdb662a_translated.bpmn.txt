 When a regression case is reported, the system initiates a series of tasks and gateways to address the issue. First, the 'Check regression' task is triggered, which checks if the reported case is indeed a regression. If the case is confirmed as a regression, the 'is wrong?' gateway is activated, leading to two possible outcomes: 'Reimbursement period expired' or 'Disclosure of debt collection'.

If the 'Reimbursement period expired' outcome is selected, the 'VN payment request' task is triggered, which then leads to the 'EndEvent1' task. On the other hand, if 'Disclosure of debt collection' is chosen, the 'Disclosure of debt collection' task is initiated.

Simultaneously, the 'Set process for reproach' task is triggered when the 'VN contradicts' gateway is activated. This task leads to the 'Disclosure of debt collection' task, which can also be triggered by the 'Reimbursement period expired' gateway.

The 'Book payment receipt' task is initiated when the 'Regression case reported' start event occurs. This task is connected to the 'is wrong?' gateway, which can lead to either 'Reimbursement period expired' or 'Disclosure of debt collection'.

The 'Proceedings' task is triggered when the 'VN contradicts' gateway is activated, leading to the 'Close' gateway.

In summary, when a regression case is reported, the system follows a flow of tasks and gateways to address the issue, with possible outcomes including 'Reimbursement period expired', 'Disclosure of debt collection', and 'Close'.
