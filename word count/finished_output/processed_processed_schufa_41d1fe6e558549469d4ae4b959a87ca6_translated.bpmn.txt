 In the scoring process, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check the feedback' task. This task is then followed by the 'Report the first scoring result' task, which is initiated by 'StartEvent1'. The 'Check if there is a delay' task is also triggered by 'StartEvent1' and leads to the 'Report delay' task.

The 'Check the feedback' task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the 'Scoring result back' to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event is also connected to the 'Scoring done' task, which is the final step in the process.

The 'Report the first scoring result' task connects to the 'ParallelGateway2', which then leads to the 'perform scoring level 2' task. This task is connected to the'second scoring back' task, which ultimately leads to the 'Scoring performed' task.

The 'Check if there is a delay' task connects to the 'ParallelGateway2', which then leads to the 'perform scoring level 2' task. This task is connected to the'second scoring back' task, which ultimately leads to the 'Scoring performed' task.
