 The process begins when goods are to be shipped, triggering the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which sends the goods to ExclusiveGateway1. At ExclusiveGateway1, the Sekretariat clarifies the shipping route and sends the goods to ParallelGateway4. ParallelGateway4 then sends the goods to ParallelGateway5, where a Specialist is involved. The Specialist selects the offer and sends the shipment to the Shipment endpoint. Meanwhile, the Sekretariat also handles the insurance notwendig question, which leads to ExclusiveGateway1 and eventually to the Closing business event. The process concludes when the shipment is ready, involving the Specialist and ending at the Shipment endpoint.
