 When a scoring request is obtained, the system initiates a series of tasks to process and report the results. The process begins with sending a scoring inquiry to Schufa, which is then followed by a delay to obtain a message. Once the message is received, the scoring results are reported to the frontend through EventBasedGateway1. Concurrently, a scoring result with a level 1 message is also reported through the same gateway. Additionally, a scoring result with a level 2 message is completed, which is linked to the initial request with a unique identifier. The system ensures that all these tasks are executed in a coordinated manner, with the final step being the sending of the scoring results to the frontend.
