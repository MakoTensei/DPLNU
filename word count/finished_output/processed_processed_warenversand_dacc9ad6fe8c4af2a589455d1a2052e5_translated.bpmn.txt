 Starting with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', the process unfolds as follows:

1. The event 'Goods are to be shipped' triggers 'Pick up offers' through ExclusiveGateway0.
2. 'Pick up offers' then leads to 'Create a quote' via ParallelGateway3.
3. 'Create a quote' connects to 'Select best offer' through ParallelGateway5.
4. 'Select best offer' sends the goods for collection by passing through ExclusiveGateway2.
5. Finally, 'Provide goods for collection' is the endpoint event, which is directly linked to ParallelGateway6.

This sequence of events and gateways ensures that the process of shipping goods is efficiently managed, from picking up offers to providing the goods for collection.
