 Let's start with the process triggered by the 'Schufa request obtained' event:

1. The 'Schufa request obtained' event is received by the 'EventBasedGateway0'.
2. This event triggers the 'Report delay' process, which is initiated by the'sid-sid-D883B2C5-E7C4-42AB-9420-002D1B8E7C68' task.
3. The 'Report delay' process sends a 'Result of Request obtained' message to 'EventBasedGateway0'.
4. Upon receiving the 'Result of Request obtained' message, 'EventBasedGateway0' triggers the 'EndEvent1' process.

Next, let's look at the process initiated by the 'Schufa.\nInformation request obtained' event:

1. The 'Schufa.\nInformation request obtained' event is received by the 'EventBasedGateway1'.
2. This event triggers the 'Delay View' process, initiated by the'sid-sid-DFF9C5AB-FF9A-4EA7-86E8-08A133DC3036' task.
3. The 'Delay View' process sends a 'Delay Report' message to 'EventBasedGateway1'.
4. Upon receiving the 'Delay Report' message, 'EventBasedGateway1' triggers the 'EndEvent3' process.

Now, let's examine the processes initiated by the 'Level 1 Scoring' and 'after XY minutes' events:

1. The 'Level 1 Scoring' event is received by the'sid-sid-D6DF5106-98BB-4829-A2E1-A0A595877D09' task.
2. This task sends a 'Level 2 Scoring' message to 'EventBasedGateway0'.
3. 'EventBasedGateway0' triggers the 'EndEvent1' process.

4. The 'after XY minutes' event is received by the'sid-sid-
