 When a 'Regression possibility\nNot applicable' event occurs, it triggers an 'Examination' process, which can lead to either a 'Debt collection' or a 'Process' outcome. If the 'Examination' process determines a 'Regression' possibility, it then leads to a 'Debt collection' outcome. Conversely, if the 'Examination' process does not find a 'Regression' possibility, it results in a 'Process' outcome. Additionally, the 'Money received' event can initiate a 'Process' outcome, while the 'References' event also leads to a 'Process' outcome. The 'Send a message' and '2 days\nReimbursement' events can both result in a 'Debt collection' outcome.
