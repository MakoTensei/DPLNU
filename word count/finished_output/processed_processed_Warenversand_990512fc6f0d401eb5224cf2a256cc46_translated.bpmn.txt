 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Request a quote' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Select your offer' task. The 'Select your offer' task is then connected to the 'Shipping a lot?' event, which directs the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway connects to the 'Specialist' task, which then leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' is connected to the 'Packaging goods' task, which finally ends the process at the 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'Shipping a lot?' event also leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, which then leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' is connected to the 'EndEvent0', completing the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0' and ends at the 'EndEvent0'. The tasks involved in this process are 'Request a quote', 'Select your offer', 'Specialist', 'Packaging goods', and 'Complete insurance'. The 'Shipping a lot?' event triggers the 'Filling the package note' and 'Complete insurance' tasks, while the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5' connect different tasks in the process.
