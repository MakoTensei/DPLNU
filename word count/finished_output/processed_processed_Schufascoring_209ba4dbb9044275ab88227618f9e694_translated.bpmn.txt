 In a customer support system, the following processes and interactions occur:

1. The system starts with a 'Start Customer - Weakened' event, which triggers the Frontend process.
2. The Frontend process receives incoming requests for 'Incoming Scoring' and 'Incoming Scoring Request'.
3. The Frontend process sends outgoing messages to 'Frontend' and 'Renewed Scoring Question'.
4. The 'End or Intermediate Result' gateway receives incoming 'Incoming Scoring Request' and sends outgoing messages to 'Distribution Informed'.
5. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway receives incoming 'Incoming Scoring Request' and sends outgoing messages to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'.
6. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' gateway receives incoming 'Scoring Request to Schufa the' and sends outgoing messages to 'Distribution Informed'.
7. The 'Final Answer?' gateway receives incoming 'Incoming Scoring' and sends outgoing messages to 'Scoring Result Sent'.
8. The 'Distribution Informed' gateway receives incoming 'End or Intermediate Result' and sends outgoing messages to 'Distribution Informed'.
9. The 'Customer - Talk Completed' event occurs, indicating the completion of a customer interaction.
10. The 'Scoring Result Sent' event occurs, indicating the successful transmission of scoring results.

Overall, the system handles customer requests, performs scoring, and communicates results to the appropriate parties, ensuring a smooth and efficient customer support process.
