 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to handle the incoming task. This gateway then sends the task to 'Pick up offers' and 'Good quality' tasks. The 'Pick up offers' gateway receives the task and sends it to 'Select your offer', which in turn sends the task to 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' gateway then sends the task to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, 'Good quality' task is also sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3' from 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Specialist' gateway, upon receiving the task, sends it to 'Filling the package note' which then sends the task to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway receives the task and sends it to 'Complete insurance'. The 'Complete insurance' task, upon receiving the task, sends it back to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway then sends the task to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway receives the task and sends it to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' gateway receives the task and sends it to 'Good quality'.

Finally, the 'Good quality' task is completed, marking the end of the process.
