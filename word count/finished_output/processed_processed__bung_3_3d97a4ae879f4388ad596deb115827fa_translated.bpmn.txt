 When a regression takes place, it triggers a series of events and interactions within the system. The process begins with the 'Regression takes place' event, which initiates the following sequence:

1. The 'Regression takes place' event triggers the 'Book money receipt' task, which records the occurrence of the regression.
2. The 'Book money receipt' task then sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'VN payment request' task, indicating that a payment request has been made.
3. The 'VN payment request' task receives the signal and sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'Objection received' task, indicating that an objection has been received.
4. The 'Objection received' task sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'Inkasso-Diestwandr' task, which handles the objection.
5. The 'Inkasso-Diestwandr' task sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'EndEvent4' task, marking the end of the objection process.
6. Meanwhile, the 'VN payment request' task also sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which determines the next course of action based on the incoming signal.
7. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'EndEvent2' task, marking the end of the process.
8. The 'EndEvent2' task sends an 'outgoing' signal to the 'Close the process' task, which finalizes the entire process.

In summary, when a regression occurs, it sets off a chain of events and interactions that involve booking a money receipt, handling a VN payment request, and addressing any objections that may arise. The process concludes with the finalization of the entire process.
