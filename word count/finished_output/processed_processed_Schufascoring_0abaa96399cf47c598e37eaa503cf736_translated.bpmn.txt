 The process begins with a 'Schufascoring request' that has been discussed, leading to a series of tasks and interactions between different components:

1. The initial 'Schufascoring request' is received and triggers the 'forward scoring results' task, which in turn processes the request and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

2. Concurrently, the 'Schufascoring request' also leads to the 'Scoring currently not possible' task due to some unresolved issues. This task sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0' as well.

3. Meanwhile, the 'Schufascoring request' also initiates the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task, which determines the scoring and sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

4. The 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task also triggers the 'Scoring determined' task, which sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

5. The 'Scoring determined' task is also linked to the 'Transfer scoring results' task, which sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

6. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, triggered by the 'Schufascoring request', sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

7. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task, also triggered by the 'Schufascoring request', determines the scoring and sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

8. The 'Scoring currently not possible' task sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0' again.

9. Finally, the 'Scoring request' task is processed, and the result is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

In summary, the 'Schufascoring request' initiates a series of tasks and interactions between different components, leading to the processing and determination of the scoring. The results are then transferred to the appropriate gateways for further processing or determination.
