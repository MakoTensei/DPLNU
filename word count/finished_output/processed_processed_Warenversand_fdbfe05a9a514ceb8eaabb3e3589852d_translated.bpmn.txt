 The process begins with the 'Shipment of goods' start event, which triggers the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task. This task requires the 'Select shipping mode' gateway, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Once the shipping mode is selected, the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway is activated, leading to the 'Filling the package note' task. This task sends data to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and then to the 'ParallelGateway4'.

Next, the 'Select shipping mode' gateway connects to the 'ParallelGateway3', which then leads to the 'Pick up offers' task. This task requires the 'Select shipping mode' gateway, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Select shipping mode' gateway also connects to the 'Specialist' task, which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Specialist' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which leads to the 'Select a quote' task. This task requires the 'Select shipping mode' gateway, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Select a quote' task then connects to the 'Specialist' task, which also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Select a quote' task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to the 'Provide goods for collection' task. This task requires the 'EndEvent0' start event, which connects to the'sid-5AF02B4C-CCA1-4297-92F1-D2E636115853' end event.

In summary, the process involves the following tasks and gateways:

1. 'Shipment of goods' start event -> 'Clearing the shipping mode' task -> 'Select shipping mode' gateway -> 'ExclusiveGateway2'
2. 'Select shipping mode' gateway -> 'ParallelGateway3' -> 'Filling the package note' task -> 'ExclusiveGateway2' -> 'ParallelG
