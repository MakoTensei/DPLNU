 In the case of a regress, the system initiates a series of tasks and gateways to manage the situation. First, the 'Regress' event triggers the 'Check the case' task, which then sends a message to 'Send a message' task. This message is directed towards 'Payment request' task, which in turn prompts 'Deposit money' task. Concurrently, 'Regress' event also leads to 'Proceedings' task, which initiates 'Debt collection' task.

The 'Regress?' gateway receives the 'Regress' event and directs it to 'Book the entrance' task, which closes the process. Additionally, it also sends 'Close process' to 'Notification' and 'Objection' tasks.

Meanwhile, 'EventBasedGateway3' receives 'Regress' event and routes it to 'Money received' task, 'Rejection of payment right?' task, and 'Debt collection' task.

The 'Payment auff.' gateway, upon receiving 'Payment request' event, triggers 'Deposit money' task and 'Objection' task.

Lastly, 'Reimbursement' gateway, upon receiving 'Regress' event, sends 'Money received' task to close the process.

In summary, the system handles a regress by initiating tasks and gateways to check the case, send messages, book the entrance, proceed with debt collection, and close the process.
