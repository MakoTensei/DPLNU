 In the world of scoring, a series of events and tasks unfold to ensure the accurate and timely processing of requests. It all begins when the Schufascoring system receives a request, which triggers the 'Request send' task with the ID'sid-8124EDD2-961D-48D7-BCA0-66E7C2E0986F'. This request is then directed to the ExclusiveGateway0, which is responsible for handling incoming requests and sending out the 'Schufascoring obtained' result.

As the process continues, the Schufascoring system receives another request, this time through the EventBasedGateway2, which triggers the 'Report delay' task with the ID'sid-3F3F4353-D803-43B1-98D3-7FAEDD26F82C'. This task is then directed to the ExclusiveGateway0, which sends out the 'Delay obtained' result.

Meanwhile, the Schufascoring system also performs the 'Scoring (level 1) perform' task with the ID'sid-A28ADE23-E861-491F-8A8C-5E07255C5A27', which is triggered by the 'Request received' event. The results of this task are determined and sent out as the 'Results determined' result.

As the process continues, the Schufascoring system receives a new request, which triggers the 'Scoring (level 2) perform' task with the ID'sid-425A22FC-522A-491D-A164-474B60898461'. This task is performed when the 'Result available?' event occurs, and the results are determined and sent out as the 'Results determined' result.

In summary, the Schufascoring system processes requests through a series of tasks and gateways, ensuring that the results are obtained and delivered in a timely and accurate manner. The system starts with the 'Request send' task, which is directed to the ExclusiveGateway0,
