The 'Check if insurance is required' task is linked to 'Pick up three offers' and 'Select a quote' tasks, while 'ExclusiveGateway2' connects to 'Select a quote' and 'Goods ready for dispatch' tasks.

The 'Select a quote' task is also triggered by the 'big crowd?' event, which leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway connects to 'Insurance required?' and 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' task is connected to 'Goods ready for dispatch', which is an end event. This task is triggered by the 'Insurance required?' event, which in turn is triggered by the 'big crowd?' event.
