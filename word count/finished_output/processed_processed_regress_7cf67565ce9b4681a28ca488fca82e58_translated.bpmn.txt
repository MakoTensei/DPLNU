 In a flowing narrative, the process begins with the event 'VN can be found in Regress we have taken', which triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway. This gateway has two outcomes: 'Check regression' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Check regression' task is executed, and upon completion, it leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, 'ExclusiveGateway1' also receives the incoming event and directs it to 'EndEvent0' and 'Close'.

Meanwhile, 'EventBasedGateway4' is triggered by 'VN can be found in Regress we have taken' and directs the flow to 'Proceedings' and 'Reimbursement'. The 'Proceedings' task is executed, leading to 'ExclusiveGateway3', while 'Reimbursement' leads to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Opposition justified?' task is triggered by 'EventBasedGateway4' and directs the flow to 'Close' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is executed, leading to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Reimbursement' task, triggered by 'EventBasedGateway4', also leads to 'EndEvent1'. Additionally, 'Money received' and 'Objection' events, both triggered by 'EventBasedGateway4', are directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

In summary, the process starts with 'VN can be found in Regress we have taken', which leads to 'Check regression' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. 'Check regression' results in 'EndEvent0', while 'ExclusiveGateway1' also leads to 'EndEvent0' and 'Close'. 'EventBasedGateway4' triggers 'Proceedings' and 'Reimbursement', which both lead to 'EndEvent1'. 'Opposition justified?' triggers 'Close' and 'ExclusiveGateway3', which also leads to 'EndEvent1'. 'Reimbursement' and 'Money received' and 'Objection' events are directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The process concludes with 'EndEvent0'
