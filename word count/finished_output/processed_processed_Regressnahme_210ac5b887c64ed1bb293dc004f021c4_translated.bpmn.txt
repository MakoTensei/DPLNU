 In the case of a regression claim, the process begins with the 'Regression claim\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Opposition\nCheck' task. This task is then directed to the 'Righteous?' gateway, which has two possible outcomes: 'Justified?' and 'Process closed'. If the claim is justified, the process moves to the 'Set payment request to VN and WV' task, which sends an 'Incoming payment\nTable' to the 'Incoming payment\nTable' gateway.
