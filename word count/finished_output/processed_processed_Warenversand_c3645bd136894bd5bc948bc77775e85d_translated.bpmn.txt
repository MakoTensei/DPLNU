 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the '3 Request offers from forwarders' task. This task, in turn, initiates the 'Special delivery necessary?' task, which connects to the 'Special delivery necessary?' gateway. The gateway then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which is responsible for 'Filling standard package voucher'. This task requires the 'Special delivery necessary?' task to be completed first.

Simultaneously, the '3 Request offers from forwarders' task also connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' task. This task is triggered by the 'Packaging goods' task, which is initiated by the 'Goods be sent' event. The 'ParallelGateway5' task is linked to the 'EndEvent0' task, which is triggered by the 'is insurance necessary?' task.

The 'Special delivery necessary?' task also connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, which is triggered by the 'is insurance necessary?' task. This task leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which is responsible for 'Filling standard package voucher'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'EndEvent0' task. The tasks and gateways are interconnected, with some tasks requiring the completion of others before they can proceed.
