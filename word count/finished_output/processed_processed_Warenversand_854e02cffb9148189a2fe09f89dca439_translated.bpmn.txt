 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task, which then sends the offer to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway forwards the offer to the 'Decision' task, which in turn sends the decision to 'Orders\nDedicated'. The 'Orders\nDedicated' task then sends the order details to 'ParallelGateway3', which forwards the details to 'Shipping\nCheck quantity'. The 'Shipping\nCheck quantity' task sends the shipping details to 'Type of transport\ndecide', which then sends the transport decision to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task sends the transport decision to 'Packing goods', which then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'ParallelGateway3' task forwards the goods to 'Provide goods for collection', which then sends the goods to 'Goods to forwarders'. Finally, the 'Goods to forwarders' task sends the goods to 'EndEvent0', completing the process.
