 The process begins with the 'Goods\nShip' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task. This task then leads to the 'Special shipment?' event, which in turn initiates the 'Filling the package note' task. The 'Filling the package note' task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which subsequently leads to the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task connects back to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and also to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

Meanwhile, the 'Special shipment?' event also triggers the 'Specialist' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' task then leads to the 'Shipment\nprepared' event.

The 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers' task also connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task. This task connects to the 'Special shipment?' event, which in turn triggers the 'Specialist' task.

Finally, the 'Specialist' task connects back to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to the 'Shipment\nprepared' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods\nShip' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Shipment\nprepared' event. The process involves tasks such as 'Pick up offers from 3 carriers', 'Clearing the shipping mode', 'Filling the package note', 'Complete insurance', and 'Specialist', as well as gateways like 'ExclusiveGateway2', 'ExclusiveGateway3', and 'ParallelGateway4'.
