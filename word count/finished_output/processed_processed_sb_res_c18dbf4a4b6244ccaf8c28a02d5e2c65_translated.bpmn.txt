 When someone experiences hunger, they initiate the process by expressing their need for food, which triggers the 'Hunger!' start event. This leads to the 'Add your order' task, where they select a court to proceed. Upon choosing a court, the 'on the line?' gateway directs them to 'Add your order' task.

Once the order is added, the 'Enter your order in cash system' task is triggered, which requires a recording of the order. This recording then leads to the 'cassing' task, where the order is processed in the cash system.

Following the cash system processing, the 'Add Pieper' task is initiated, which also requires a recording of the order. The 'Add Pieper' task then leads to the'sid-464401A2-5BC3-4796-9889-90D08EC07BE0' task, which likely represents the next step in the order fulfillment process.

After the order is prepared, the 'Deposition of meal in passing' task is triggered, which also requires a recording. This task leads to the 'inform employees' end event, where the employees are notified about the meal's arrival.
