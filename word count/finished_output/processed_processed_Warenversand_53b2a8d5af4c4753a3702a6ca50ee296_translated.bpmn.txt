 When an order is pending, the process begins with the 'Order pending' event, which triggers the 'Select your offer' task. This task prompts the user to choose an offer for forwarders. Once the offer is selected, the 'Select your offer' task sends an incoming message to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway then receives the 'Order quantity?' message from the 'Order quantity?' gateway and sends it to the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Packaging goods' task, in turn, sends an incoming message to the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway.

The 'ParallelGateway5' gateway receives the 'ParallelGateway4' message from the 'Order pending' event and sends it to the 'Filling the package note' task. The 'Filling the package note' task sends an incoming message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway receives the 'Complete insurance?' message from the 'Insurance necessary?' event and sends it to the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task sends an incoming message to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway receives the 'Order quantity?' message from the 'Packaging goods' task and sends it to the 'Delivering goods' task. The 'Delivering goods' task sends an incoming message to the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway.

Finally, the 'ParallelGateway5' gateway receives the 'Goods shipped' message from the 'Complete insurance' task and sends it to the 'End Events' event, completing the process.
