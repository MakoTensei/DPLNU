 In the financial services system, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process and score Schufa requests. The process begins with a Schufa request and Report, which triggers a Level 1 scoring task. This task, upon completion, sends a 'Level 1 scoring obtained' message to the EventBasedGateway3, which then forwards the request to the Scoring task.


The Scoring task, upon receiving the 'Scoring request Report', conducts the scoring and sends a 'Scoring request Finished' message to the ExclusiveGateway2. Concurrently, it also sends a 'Send Level 2 scoring' message to the same ExclusiveGateway2.


The ExclusiveGateway2, upon receiving the 'Send Level 2 scoring' message, forwards the request to the Level 2 Scoring task. This task, after completing the scoring, sends a 'Result?' message to the Result? gateway.


The Result? gateway, upon receiving the 'Result?' message, sends a 'Scoring request Finished' message to the ExclusiveGateway2 and a 'Send Level 2 scoring' message to itself, thus completing the process.


In summary, the process starts with a Schufa request and Report, which triggers a Level 1 scoring task. The Level 1 scoring task sends a 'Level 1 scoring obtained' message to the EventBasedGateway3, which forwards the request to the Scoring task. The Scoring task conducts the scoring and sends a 'Scoring request Finished' message to the ExclusiveGateway2, which also sends a 'Send Level 2 scoring' message to itself. The Level 2 Scoring task sends a 'Result?' message to the Result? gateway, which completes the process by sending a 'Scoring request Finished' message to the ExclusiveGateway2 and a 'Send Level 2 scoring' message to itself.
