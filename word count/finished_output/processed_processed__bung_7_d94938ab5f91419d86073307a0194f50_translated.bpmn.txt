 In the creditworthiness assessment process, the following sequence of events and gateways are involved:

1. The process begins with a 'Creditworthiness Check' event, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway sends the 'Creditworthiness Examination' task to the next stage and also reports a 'Delay'.
