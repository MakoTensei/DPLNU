 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task receives incoming data from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends out an offer selection prompt to the user. Once the offer is selected, the 'Select your offer' task is triggered, which also receives data from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends a beeping signal to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Clearing insurance requirements' task is initiated, which receives data from 'Lot?' and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is followed by the 'Complete insurance' task, which also receives data from 'Lot?' and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Filling the package note' task is triggered next, receiving data from 'Lot?' and sending out insurance clearance requirements to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Packaging goods' task is then initiated, receiving data from 'ParallelGateway4' and sending it to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Finally, the 'Provide for collection' task is triggered, receiving data from 'ParallelGateway5' and ending the process with the 'EndEvent0' event.
