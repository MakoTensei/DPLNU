 When a "Reported" event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and processes. First, the "Send a message" task is initiated, which sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway0". This message is then processed by "ExclusiveGateway0", which in turn sends a message to "Set on re-submission". The "Set on re-submission" task is then processed, leading to a "Reimbursement period expired" event. This event triggers the "Disclosure of debt collection" task, which sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway2". "ExclusiveGateway2" processes this task and sends a message to "Process". Concurrently, the "Reported" event also triggers the "Proceedings" task, which sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway2". This task is processed by "ExclusiveGateway2", which then sends a message to "Process". Additionally, the "Reported" event also triggers the "Incoming payment" task, which sends a message to "ExclusiveGateway0". This task is processed by "ExclusiveGateway0", which then sends a message to "Process". Lastly, the "Reported" event also triggers the "Opposition" task, which sends a message to "EventBasedGateway3". This task is processed by "EventBasedGateway3", which then sends a message to "Process". All these tasks and interactions ultimately lead to the "Process" event, which is the final outcome of the series of events triggered by the initial "Reported" event.
