 The process begins with the 'Goods to be sent' event, which triggers the 'Lot?' event. This event checks the quantity of goods and determines if insurance is necessary. If insurance is required, the 'Insurance necessary?' event is triggered, which in turn leads to the 'Insurance\ncommission' event.

The 'Insurance\ncommission' event is then connected to the 'ParallelGateway3' event, which checks the insurance requirements and sends the goods to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway4' event, which is responsible for the shipment commission.

The 'ParallelGateway4' event also receives the 'Insurance\ndeported' event, which is triggered when the insurance requirements are met. This event leads to the 'EndEvent1' event, marking the completion of the process.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:
1. 'Goods to be sent' event triggers 'Lot?' event.
2. 'Lot?' event checks quantity and determines if insurance is necessary.
3. If insurance is required, 'Insurance necessary?' event is triggered.
4. 'Insurance\ncommission' event is connected to 'ParallelGateway3'.
5. 'ParallelGateway3' sends goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends goods to 'ParallelGateway4'.
7. 'ParallelGateway4' receives 'Insurance\ndeported' event and triggers 'EndEvent1'.

This process ensures that the goods are properly insured and shipped, with all necessary events and gateways involved in the process.
