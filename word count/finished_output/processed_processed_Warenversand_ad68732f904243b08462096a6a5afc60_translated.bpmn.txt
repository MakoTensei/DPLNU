 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with determining the shipping method, which involves a parallel gateway to select the appropriate offer. Following this, the pick up offers are presented to the customer, and the goods are packaged. The shipping type is then determined through a gateways that can handle multiple incoming requests. Once the shipping type is decided, the goods are ready for dispatch.


The process flow is as follows:

1. Goods are to be shipped (Start Event).

2. Determine the shipping method (ParallelGateway4, incoming from Start Event).

3. Present pick up offers (ParallelGateway5, outgoing from Determine the shipping method).

4. Packaging goods (ParallelGateway5, outgoing from Present pick up offers).

5. Determine the shipping type (Gateway with id'sid-3CCF770A-EAA3-406F-AF05-2EF2325E46C1', incoming from Packaging goods).

6. Select the appropriate offer (ExclusiveGateway1, outgoing from Determine the shipping type).

7. Fill the package note (Gateway with id'sid-4649B328-1244-49C0-93D0-2D8A93A511B1', incoming from Select the appropriate offer).

8. Goods are ready for dispatch (End Event).
