 The process begins with the dispatch of goods, which triggers the 'Goods dispatched they are' event. This event has an outgoing link to 'Lot?', which is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Lot?' gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Determination of quantity' task.

Once the quantity is determined, the process moves to 'Pick up offers from forwarders', which is managed by 'ParallelGateway3'. This task connects to 'Select your offer', which is handled by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Select your offer' task then leads to 'Appoint forwarding', managed by 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Appoint forwarding' task connects to 'Filling the package note', which is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task then leads to 'Packaging goods', managed by 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Packaging goods' task connects to 'Provide goods for collection', managed by 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Provide goods for collection' task connects to 'Complete insurance', which is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Complete insurance' task then leads to 'Shipment prepared', managed by 'ParallelGateway4'.

In summary, the process starts with the dispatch of goods, leading to the determination of quantity, picking up offers, selecting an offer, appointing forwarding, filling the package note, packaging goods, providing goods for collection, and finally completing insurance before the goods are prepared for shipment.
