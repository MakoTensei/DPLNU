 The Schufa Service Call initiates with the 'Schufa-Auskunft\nStart\n' event, which triggers the Level 1 gateway, 'Level?'. This gateway then forwards the request to the 'Scoring\n' service, identified by'sid-EF265ACE-B538-4958-BB04-D9574D5AB881'. The 'Scoring\n' service, in turn, sends the request to the Level 2 scoring service,'sid-051F3940-D1B4-4727-B7FC-AD154A358B72'. The Level 2 scoring service then passes the request to 'IntermediateCatchEvent1', identified by'sid-40E5FAD1-B651-4F1E-952F-DA6888E91978'. This event is then caught by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway,'sid-1135579A-5B45-4F2A-8F68-122FA93CFDEE', which sends the request back to the Level 1 gateway. The Level 1 gateway then concludes the process with the 'EndEvent0' event, identified by'sid-254758E2-DFBB-433F-A4CE-7ED6BBF190F1'.
