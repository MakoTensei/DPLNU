 The shipping process begins with the 'Shipping goods' task, which triggers the 'Requesting quotes' task. The 'Requesting quotes' task then leads to the 'Select your offer' task, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. The 'Check the insurance requirement' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', and the 'Insurance close' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Select your offer' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task, which is triggered by the 'Shipping goods' task, connects to the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task and the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Clearing the shipping mode' task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, while the 'Packaging goods' task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway4' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task connects to the 'Specialist' task, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task connects to the 'Delivering goods' task, which finally leads to the 'EndEvent0' task.

In summary, the shipping process involves tasks such as 'Clearing the shipping mode', 'Requesting quotes', 'Selecting an offer', 'Checking insurance requirements', 'Insurance close', 'Specialist', and 'Delivering goods', all of which are connected through various gateways to ensure a smooth and efficient shipping process.
