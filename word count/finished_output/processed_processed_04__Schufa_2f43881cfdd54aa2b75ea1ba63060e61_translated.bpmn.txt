 In the process of handling a scoring request, the system initiates by sending a request for Schufa Information, which is then directed to ExclusiveGateway1. Upon receiving the Schufa Information, the system proceeds to Level 1 scoring, where it performs the scoring and sends the results to the Frontend.

Once the Level 1 scoring is complete, Zw.Result is sent to the Frontend. Concurrently, the system also sends the scoring results to EndEvent2.

After Level 1 scoring, the system receives Schufa Information again and sends it to EndEvent2. The Level 1 scoring results are then sent to Schufa Information, which is subsequently sent to the Frontend.

The process begins with the Schufa Information request, which is sent to ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway then forwards the request to IntermediateCatchEvent3, which sends the Schufa Information to Zw.Result. Zw.Result, in turn, sends the results to the Frontend.

Meanwhile, the Level 1 scoring request is sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which forwards it to Level 1. Level 1 performs the scoring and sends the results to EndEvent2. The Level 1 OK event is also triggered, which sends the Schufa Information to EndEvent2.

The scoring results from Level 1 are then sent to Scoring result, which sends the results to Schufa Information. Schufa Information is then sent to the Frontend.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:

1. Schufa Information request is sent to ExclusiveGateway1.
2. ExclusiveGateway1 forwards the request to IntermediateCatchEvent3, which sends the Schufa Information to Zw.Result.
3. Zw.Result sends the results to the Frontend.
4. Level 1 scoring request is sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which forwards it to Level 1.
5. Level 1 performs the scoring and sends the results to EndEvent2.
6. Level 1 OK event sends the Schufa Information to EndEvent2.
7. Scoring results from Level 1 are sent to Scoring result, which sends the results to Schufa Information.
