 In a legal case management system, the following tasks and gateways are interconnected to handle various stages of a case:

1. When the case starts, the 'StartEvent0' triggers the 'Regress?' gateway, which can set the case to 'WV' (Waiting Verification) if needed.
2. If the case is set to 'WV', the 'Set case to WV' task is executed.
3. The 'Incoming payment' task is triggered when a payment is received, and it connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to process the payment.
4. The 'Check the case' task is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3' to verify the case status.
5. The 'EventBasedGateway4' receives an 'Opposition' event and connects to the 'EndEvent0' to conclude the proceedings.
6. The 'Justified?' gateway is triggered by 'EventBasedGateway4' and can either proceed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' or end the case.
7. The 'Proceedings' task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' to initiate the next steps in the case.
8. The 'WV-Frist expired' task is triggered by 'EventBasedGateway4' and connects to 'Payment request' to handle the expired waiting verification.

Overall, the system ensures that each task and gateway is connected to the appropriate incoming and outgoing events, allowing for a smooth and efficient case management process.
