 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the '3 Special Delivery Offers' task. The customer is then presented with a selection of special delivery offers. Once a selection is made, the 'Select your offer' task is initiated, leading to the 'Order for forwarding' task. The order is then forwarded through the 'ParallelGateway4', which is also the incoming gateway for the 'Complete standard package ticket' task. This task is completed, and the 'Goods sent' event is triggered, marking the end of the shipping process.

During the shipping process, the customer may also inquire about insurance, which leads to the 'Complete insurance' task. This task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn triggers the 'Goods sent' event.

Additionally, the 'Packaging of goods' task is initiated when goods are to be shipped, and it connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is completed, and the 'Goods sent' event is triggered, completing the shipping process.

In summary, the shipping process involves the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, the '3 Special Delivery Offers' task, the 'Select your offer' task, the 'Order for forwarding' task, the 'Complete standard package ticket' task, the 'Complete insurance' task, and the 'Packaging of goods' task, all leading to the 'Goods sent' event.
