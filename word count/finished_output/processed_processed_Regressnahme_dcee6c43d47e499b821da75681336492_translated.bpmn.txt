 The process begins with the 'Report\nRegression' task, which is triggered by incoming data and leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then sends a 'Report\nRegression' to the 'Regression\npossible?' gateways, which in turn directs the process to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'EndEvent0'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' receives the 'Report\nRegression' and sends an 'Incoming payment\nobtained' event to the 'Send payment request to VN' task, which then triggers the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' sends the 'Incoming payment\nobtained' event to the 'Book payment receipt' task, which concludes the process with the 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'Opposition\nobtained' event from 'EventBasedGateway3' triggers the 'Opposition\njustified?' gateways, which then directs the process to 'EndEvent0' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'EndEvent0' and 'Opposition\nobtained' events, and sends them to the 'Reimbursement period\nachieved' task, which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Report\nRegression' task, which triggers a series of gateways and tasks, ultimately leading to the 'EndEvent0'. The process involves examining the regression case, sending payment requests, setting up a resubmission process, booking payment receipts, and handling opposition cases.
