 Upon entering the system, an individual is first directed to the 'EventBasedGateway2' where they are tasked with the 'Payment method'. Once the payment method is successfully completed, the individual proceeds to the 'Regression' task, which involves an 'Examination of regression'. This examination leads to the 'Payment method' gateway, where the individual is then directed to the 'Reimbursement' task.

The 'Reimbursement' task, upon completion, sends the individual to the 'Book the entrance' task. This task is followed by the 'Remarks Customer' task, which concludes the process.

Alternatively, if the individual chooses the 'Test' task upon entering, they are directed to the 'Cash receipt yes/no' task. Depending on the outcome of the cash receipt, the individual is then directed to either the 'forwarding to debt collection' or 'no process' task.

In both scenarios, the process concludes with the 'Close' task, which marks the end of the individual's journey through the system.
