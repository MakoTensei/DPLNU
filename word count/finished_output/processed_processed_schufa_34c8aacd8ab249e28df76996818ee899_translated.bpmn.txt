 The process begins with the 'StartEvent1' which triggers the 'perform scoring\nLevel 1' task. This task is responsible for scoring at the first level and its completion is signaled by the 'Results available?' event. This event is then received by the 'Results available?' gateway, which subsequently leads to the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent4'.

Simultaneously, the 'perform scoring\nLevel 1' task also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway receives the'sid-59FEB88C-2C73-438C-9196-27679ACDFC94' event and sends a 'Delay message' to'sid-48D14B6B-D6CC-48C3-B227-09DE7E80EF4E'.

Meanwhile, the 'EventBasedGateway1' also triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task. This task is responsible for catching intermediate events and its completion is signaled by the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'perform scoring\nLevel 1' task also triggers the 'Scoring result' task. This task is responsible for finalizing the scoring results and its completion is signaled by the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent1', which triggers the 'perform scoring\nLevel 1' task. This task scores at the first level, sends a 'Delay message' through 'EventBasedGateway1', and triggers 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. The 'Results available?' event is then received by the 'Results available?' gateway, leading to 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent4'. The 'Scoring result' task finalizes the scoring results, signaled by 'EndEvent0'.
