 In the credit scoring process, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure accurate and timely results. The process begins with a 'StartEvent0', which triggers a 'Report delay in lending' task. This task is then passed to an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which eventually leads to an 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, a 'StartEvent1' initiates a 'Report delay' task, which is directed to an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. This event is connected to a 'Scoring request to Schufa' task, which is then passed to an 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, a 'Create scoring level 1' task is triggered by 'StartEvent1', leading to an 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway connects to a 'Scoring successful?' task, which in turn leads to an 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Determining scoring level 2' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', is directed to an 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway connects to an 'EndEvent1' and a 'Determining scoring level 2' task.

In summary, the credit scoring process involves a series of tasks and gateways that work together to report delays, request scoring, and determine scoring levels. The process ensures that credit decisions are made based on accurate and timely information.
