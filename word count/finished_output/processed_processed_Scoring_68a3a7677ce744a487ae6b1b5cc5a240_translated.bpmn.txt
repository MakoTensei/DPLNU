 In the process of scoring and reporting, the system initiates with a 'Scoring request\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Submitting results\n' task at ExclusiveGateway0. This task then leads to the 'Results determined' event, which is also influenced by the 'Determining scoring level 1' task. Concurrently, the 'Requirements\nReport\n' event prompts the 'Send Finals Success' task at EventBasedGateway1, resulting in the 'Information completed' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Send request' event at ExclusiveGateway0 triggers the 'Send delay message' task, which in turn leads to the 'Schufa message\nreceive -delayed\n' event. This event then triggers the 'Send delay message' task at Schufa message\nreceive -delayed\n, which eventually leads to the 'Information completed' event.

Additionally, the 'Scoring request\nReport' event also triggers the 'Submitting results\n' task at ExclusiveGateway0, which leads to the 'Results determined' event. This event is also influenced by the 'Determining scoring level 2' task.

In summary, the system processes scoring requests and reports, determines results, and sends delay messages, all while ensuring that the necessary tasks and events are triggered and completed in a seamless flow.
