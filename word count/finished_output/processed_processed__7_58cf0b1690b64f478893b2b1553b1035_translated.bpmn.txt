 In the workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Request scoring' task. This task then sends an intermediate event 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. The 'EventBasedGateway2' directs the event to 'Task2' and 'Send Level 2 scoring' tasks. 'Task2' sends an intermediate event 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' to 'forward scoring result'. The 'forward scoring result' task then concludes the process by reaching 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'Send Level 2 scoring' task sends an intermediate event 'IntermediateCatchEvent7' to 'Is there a heritage?' task. This task sends 'Send Scoring result to Bank' and 'Send delay med' tasks to the respective outgoing events. 'Send Scoring result to Bank' sends the final scoring result to the bank, while 'Send delay med' handles any delay-related tasks.

In summary, the workflow starts with 'StartEvent0', which initiates the 'Request scoring' task. This task sends intermediate events to various tasks and gateways, leading to the final scoring result being sent to the bank and any delay-related tasks being handled. The process concludes with 'EndEvent0'.
