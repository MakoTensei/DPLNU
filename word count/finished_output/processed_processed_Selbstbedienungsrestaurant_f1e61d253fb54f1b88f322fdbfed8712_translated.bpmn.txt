 A person feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant. They enter the restaurant and are prompted to select a court, which represents choosing a specific dish or cuisine. After making their selection, they proceed to the waiting queue, where they place their order.

Once their order is accepted, they are handed their meal and instructed to eat it. After finishing their meal, they trigger the "Pieper" event, which could represent a payment or a request for the bill. The restaurant staff then adjusts the bill and hands it over to the guest.

The guest's order is forwarded to the kitchen, where the meal is prepared. The kitchen staff then informs the restaurant employees about the meal's readiness.

Meanwhile, the guest waits for their meal for a specified time, indicated by the "5 min." event. Once the time is up, the kitchen staff hands over the meal to the guest.

In summary, the person's journey through the restaurant involves feeling hungry, selecting a dish, placing an order, eating the meal, paying the bill, and receiving their food.
