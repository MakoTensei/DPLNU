 When a new shipping order is initiated, it triggers the 'Clearing the shipping mode' process, which involves verifying the details of the shipment and ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place. This process is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway3', which receives the incoming request and passes it on to the 'Special shipment?' gateways.

Once the shipment details are confirmed, the 'Special shipment?' gateways, identified by'sid-DE6F2FFC-BE69-4EE5-A707-FAE21FA65E4A' and'sid-1B13C3E8-0954-4808-80DD-44D4577A76F1', handle the insurance and special shipment requirements. They then forward the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for processing the insurance and filling the package note.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateways, identified by'sid-0CE8743D-6AC3-4B87-96C2-3EF862A6B196', receive the incoming requests from the 'Special shipment?' gateways and pass them on to the 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' gateways, identified by'sid-A13CBE30-D8B6-42BE-9054-4D9B8C0ABD0E', receive the incoming requests from the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'Complete insurance' tasks. Once the shipment is ready for delivery, the 'ParallelGateway4' forwards the request to the 'EndEvent0', which signifies the completion of the shipping process.
