 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nStart the process' event, which triggers the initiation of the scoring process. This event has two incoming paths: one leading to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and the other to 'EventBasedGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then forwards the process to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which in turn sends a request to'sid-3F68F19D-8E11-4385-A5C5-B1EE6DDADCBC'. The 'EventBasedGateway2' sends the process to 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' both lead to the 'Scoring\nforward the result\nand finish the process' event, which signifies the completion of the scoring process. The 'Scoring\nforward the result\nand finish the process' event has two incoming paths: one from 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' and the other from 'EventBasedGateway2'.

The 'Processing\nFinished' event marks the end of the process and has one incoming path from 'Information immediately\npossible?'. This event does not have any outgoing paths.

In summary, the scoring process starts with the 'Schufascoring\nStart the process' event, which branches out to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EventBasedGateway2'. Both of these gateways send the process to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' respectively. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' then lead to the 'Scoring\nforward the result\nand finish the process' event, which signifies the completion of the scoring process. The process ends with the 'Processing\nFinished' event, which has one incoming path from 'Information immediately\npossible?'.
