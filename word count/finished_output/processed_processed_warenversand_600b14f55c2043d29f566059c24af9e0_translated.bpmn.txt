This process involves insurance decisions made by the logistics manager. The ExclusiveGateway1 is used for both small and large quantities, and it connects to the ExclusiveGateway3, which is responsible for combining papers and goods and preparing them for collection. The Goods are packed by warehouse workers and provided for collection through ParallelGateway4, which also leads to ParallelGateway5, finalizing the goods as ready for collection.
