 When you start your inquiry at Schufa, the system initiates a two-step scoring process. First, it begins with Level 1 scoring, which is triggered by the StartEvent1. This process is monitored by the IntermediateCatchEvent4, which catches any issues that may arise during this initial scoring phase.

Once Level 1 scoring is completed, the system moves on to Level 2 scoring, which is triggered by the EndEvent1. This second scoring phase is managed by ParallelGateway2, which ensures that the process runs smoothly and efficiently.

Throughout this process, the system checks for the success of Level 1 scoring by evaluating the Level1 successful? Gateway. If the Level 1 scoring is successful, the system proceeds to the EndEvent0. If there are any issues during the Level 1 scoring, the system redirects to the IntermediateCatchEvent4, which then connects to the EndEvent4.

In summary, the inquiry process at Schufa involves two scoring phases, with the first phase being monitored by the IntermediateCatchEvent4 and the second phase managed by ParallelGateway2. The system ensures a smooth and efficient process by evaluating the success of each scoring phase and redirecting to the appropriate end events.
