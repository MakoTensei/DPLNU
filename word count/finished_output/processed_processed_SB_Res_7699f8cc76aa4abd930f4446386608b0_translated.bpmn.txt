 Hunger triggers the process to pick up food, which leads to the guest receiving their meal. Once the guest is served, they trigger the Pieper vibrator, indicating they are waiting for a Pieper. After waiting for 5 minutes, the Pieper vibrator feedback is received, and the process adjusts Pieper and gives the guest their order. This sequence of events concludes with the guest being ready to eat.

The Court of Justice initiates the process when it receives information about a court case. This information triggers the preparation of meals for the rich, which are then put on the rich. The rich's readiness to eat is signaled, and the process concludes with the guest being ready to eat.
