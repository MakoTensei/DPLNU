 The process begins with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Send a message' task to check the case. This task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which can either result in a 'Process without result' or forward the case to 'EventBasedGateway4'. If the case is forwarded to 'EventBasedGateway4', it can lead to 'Case\nDebt collection forwarded' or 'Case successfully completed', depending on the outcome.

If the 'Regression possibility\nReport' leads to 'Set process to WV', it connects to 'Money received', which in turn leads to 'Case successfully completed'. Alternatively, if the case is forwarded to 'EventBasedGateway4', it can also result in 'Case successfully completed'.

In the case of 'ExclusiveGateway2', if the incoming event is 'Examination', it connects to 'Check the case', which can result in 'Process without result' or forward the case to 'EventBasedGateway4'.

Lastly, if the 'Regression possibility\nReport' leads to 'Representation expired', it connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which can result in 'Case successfully completed' or 'Case\nDebt collection forwarded'.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, which can lead to various tasks and gateways, ultimately resulting in either 'Case successfully completed' or 'Process without result'.
