 In the scoring process, the system starts with an event where 'Scoring is essential' is triggered, which initiates the scoring task. This event leads to 'Scoring request\nReport' being sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The scoring task is then performed, and the 'Scoring measurable?' event is triggered, which sends a reply to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'Two. Send a reply'.

Once the scoring is completed, the 'Scoring result sent\n' event is triggered, which sends the scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Concurrently, the 'Schufaservice performed' event is triggered, which sends a reply to 'Scoring measurable?' and 'Two. Send a reply'.

After the scoring result is sent, the 'Delay' event is triggered, which sends a report to 'Report Final Results at Frontend'. Finally, the 'Final scoring result' event is triggered, which sends the final scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

In summary, the scoring process involves several events and gateways, including 'Scoring is essential', 'Scoring request\nReport', 'Scoring measurable?', 'Delay', 'Scoring result sent\n', 'Schufaservice performed', and 'Final scoring result'. These events and gateways work together to ensure the scoring process is completed and the results are reported to the frontend.
