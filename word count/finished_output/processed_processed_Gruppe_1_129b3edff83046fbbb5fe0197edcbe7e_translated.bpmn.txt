 The process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' start event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to handle the incoming goods. This gateway then connects to 'Lot?' to determine the shipping options available. Once the options are presented, the user selects an offer, leading to the 'Select your offer' task. This task connects to 'Specialist' to provide further assistance. The 'Specialist' then directs the user to 'ExclusiveGateway3' for specialized shipping services.

Simultaneously, the 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to 'ParallelGateway6' to process the goods for shipping. The 'ParallelGateway6' then connects to 'EndEvent0' to signal the completion of the shipping process.
