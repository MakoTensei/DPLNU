 In the shipping process, the product is initially requested to be shipped through ExclusiveGateway0, which connects to ParallelGateway6. This triggers the 'fs Request to 3 shipping companies' task.

ParallelGateway6 then sends the product to InclusiveGateway2, which checks if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, the task 'fs Check if insurance is required' is initiated.

If insurance is not required, the product proceeds to ParallelGateway4, which offers a special deal for shipping. This leads to the 'fs Spedition1\nSpecial offer' task.

ParallelGateway4 sends the product to ExclusiveGateway1, which prepares the product for dispatch. This triggers the 'fs ready for dispatch' task.

ParallelGateway4 also sends the product to ParallelGateway5, which is connected to ExclusiveGateway1. This task is part of the shipping process but does not have a specific name.

Meanwhile, if insurance is required, the product goes to InclusiveGateway3, which completes the insurance process. This triggers the 'fs insurance complete' task.

Finally, the product is ready for dispatch, and the 'fs ready for dispatch' task is completed.
