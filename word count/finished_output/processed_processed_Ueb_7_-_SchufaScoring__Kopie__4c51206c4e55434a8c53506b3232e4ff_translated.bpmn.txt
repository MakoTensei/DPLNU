 In the system, a series of tasks and gateways are interconnected to process requests and generate results. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. A 'Schufa request\nReport' event triggers the process.
2. The 'Schufa request\nReport' event is received by the 'Scoring Level 2 Send Result' gateway, which sends a result to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
3. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway receives the result and sends it to the 'Scoring Level 2\nResult\nobtained' task, which then sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway receives the result and sends it to the 'Scoring request\nFinished' task.
5. The 'Scoring request\nFinished' task receives the result and sends a 'Scoring request\nUnbound' event to the 'Scoring Level 1 Send Result' task.
6. The 'Scoring Level 1 Send Result' task receives the 'Scoring request\nUnbound' event and sends a result to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
7. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway receives the result and sends it to the 'Scoring Level 1' task.
8. The 'Scoring Level 1' task receives the result and sends a 'forward the request' event to the 'Scoring Level 2' task.
9. The 'Scoring Level 2' task receives the 'forward the request' event and sends a 'Scoring Level 2\nResult\nobtained' event to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
10. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway receives the 'Scoring Level 2\nResult\nobtained' event and sends it to the 'Scoring request\nFinished' task.
11. The 'Scoring request\nFinished' task receives the 'Scoring Level 2\nResult\nobtained' event and sends a 'Send delay message' event to the 'Delay message\nobtained' task.
