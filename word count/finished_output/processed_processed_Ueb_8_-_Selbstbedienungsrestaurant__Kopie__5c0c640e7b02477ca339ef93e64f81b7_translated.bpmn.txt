 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural language:

1. The user feels hungry, triggering the event "Hunger felt."
2. The user decides to visit a restaurant and selects a court, initiating the event "Visit the restaurant."
3. The user adds their order to the system, starting the event "Add your order."
4. The system selects a court for the user, beginning the event "On the row."
5. The user's hunger is distilled, marking the end of the event "Hunger felt."
6. The system retrieves the guest, starting the event "Retrieve guest."
7. The user's order is obtained, triggering the event "Order obtained."
8. The system informs the employees about the order preparation, initiating the event "Inform employees."
9. The order preparation is completed, marking the end of the event "Inform employees."
10. The system triggers the Pieper, starting the event "Pieper triggered."
11. The user pays for the meal, initiating the event "Pay money."
12. The Pieper is triggered again, marking the event "Pieper triggered."
13. The meal preparation is completed, starting the event "Completion procedure obtained."
14. The user's hunger is distilled again, marking the end of the event "Hunger felt."
15. The system finishes the order, triggering the event "Order finished."

This flow of events represents the process of a user feeling hungry, visiting a restaurant, ordering food, and having it prepared and served.
