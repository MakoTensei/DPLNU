 When a shipment is necessary, the process begins with the 'Shipment necessary' event, which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task through ExclusiveGateway0. This task is then followed by 'Select your offer' task, which is initiated by ExclusiveGateway0 and leads to a Specialist task via ExclusiveGateway2. The Specialist task then connects to ExclusiveGateway1, which in turn triggers the 'Packaging goods' task through ParallelGateway3. After packaging, the goods are delivered through the 'Delivering goods' task, which is initiated by ParallelGateway4 and concludes with the 'Goods delivered' event. Additionally, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered by ExclusiveGateway2, which then connects to ExclusiveGateway1, completing the process.
