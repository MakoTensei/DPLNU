 In a bustling warehouse, a dedicated worker diligently prepares goods for collection. This task is initiated by ExclusiveGateway2, which then seamlessly transitions the goods to ParallelGateway5. Meanwhile, the Secretariat, tasked with sending the package, receives the 'Shipping goods' signal from ExclusiveGateway2 and dispatches it to ParallelGateway5.

Simultaneously, the warehouse manager, who operates as an insurance company, receives the 'Shipping goods' signal from ExclusiveGateway0 and directs it to ExclusiveGateway1. For large shipments, a special delivery team, known as Spediteur 3, takes over the process, receiving the 'Shipping goods' signal from ExclusiveGateway2 and forwarding it to ParallelGateway5.

Spediteur 1 and Spediteur 2, both handling large shipments, receive the 'Shipping goods' signal from ExclusiveGateway3 and send it to ExclusiveGateway4. Once the goods are ready for collection, the warehouse worker hands them over to ParallelGateway5, which then concludes the process with EndEvent0.
