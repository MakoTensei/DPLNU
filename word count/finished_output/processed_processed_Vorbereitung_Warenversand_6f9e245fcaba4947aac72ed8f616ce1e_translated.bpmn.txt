 When a customer inquires about a large order, the process begins with the 'Goods to be sent' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to check insurance. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Insurance necessary?' event is initiated, leading to the 'Complete insurance' event. Concurrently, the 'A lot?' event at 'ParallelGateway3' determines the quantity of goods to be sent. Once the quantity is determined, the 'Determination of quantity' event occurs, prompting the 'Insurance necessary?' event again to confirm if insurance is required.


After confirming the need for insurance, the 'need to check insurance' event is triggered at 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to the 'Complete insurance' event. Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway4' is responsible for delivering the goods, and it receives inputs from both 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event, which signifies the completion of the order fulfillment process.
