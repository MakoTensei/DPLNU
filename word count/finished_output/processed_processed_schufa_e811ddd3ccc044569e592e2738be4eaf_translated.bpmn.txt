 When a 'Schufascoring' request is initiated, it triggers the 'What feedback\nthe Schufa?' gateway, which in turn sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then forwards the request to 'Perform scoring (level 1)' and 'Perform scoring (level 2)' tasks. Once the scoring at level 1 is completed, the 'Scoring\nresult\n(level 1)\navailable?' gateway checks if the result is ready and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then triggers the 'Perform scoring (level 2)' task, which completes the scoring process. Finally, the 'Score\nat the front end\ntransmitted' event is triggered, sending the obtained score to the front end.
