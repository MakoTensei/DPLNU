 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' to initiate the packaging of goods. This leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, which then sends the packaged goods to 'Delivering goods' through 'ParallelGateway4'. Concurrently, the 'Special shipment necessary?' question is asked at 'ParallelGateway5', which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for special shipment handling. This task also involves 'Filling the package note' to complete the packaging process.

Meanwhile, the 'Insurance necessary?' question is asked at 'Clearing the shipping mode', which connects to 'Complete insurance' for insurance processing. The 'Complete insurance' task then sends the goods to 'Product is provided' through 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Special shipment necessary?' question at 'ParallelGateway5' also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' for specialist handling. The 'Specialist' task then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4' for final delivery.

Finally, the 'Product is provided' event concludes the process, with the goods being delivered and insurance completed.
