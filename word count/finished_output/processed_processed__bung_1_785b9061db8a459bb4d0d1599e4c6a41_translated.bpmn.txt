 The process begins with the 'Shipping\nOrder' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway6' to initiate the 'Complete insurance' task. This task has 'ExclusiveGateway1' as its incoming gateway and 'ParallelGateway6' as its outgoing gateway.

Once the 'Complete insurance' task is completed, 'ParallelGateway6' sends the 'Delivering goods' task to 'ParallelGateway6', which in turn triggers the 'Shipping\nOrder' task to 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the 'EndEvent0' task to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which has 'Is insurance necessary?' as its incoming task. This task is completed by 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then sends the 'EndEvent0' task back to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway5' also sends the 'EndEvent0' task to 'ParallelGateway6', which triggers the 'EndEvent1' task.

In summary, the process involves the following tasks:

1. 'Shipping\nOrder' triggers 'ParallelGateway6' to complete 'Complete insurance'.
2. 'Complete insurance' sends 'Delivering goods' to 'ParallelGateway6'.
3. 'Delivering goods' sends 'Shipping\nOrder' to 'ParallelGateway5'.
4. 'Shipping\nOrder' sends 'EndEvent0' to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway0' sends 'Is insurance necessary?' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
6. 'Is insurance necessary?' sends 'EndEvent0' to 'ParallelGateway5'.
7. 'ParallelGateway5' sends 'EndEvent0' to 'ParallelGateway6'.
8. 'ParallelGateway6' sends 'EndEvent1' to its own outgoing gateway.

This process ensures that the shipping order is completed with insurance and goods delivery, and ends with the appropriate events.
