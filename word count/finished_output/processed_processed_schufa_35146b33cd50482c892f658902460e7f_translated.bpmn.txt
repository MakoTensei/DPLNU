 When a user initiates a process, they start by triggering the 'StartEvent0' which leads to the 'Start your inquiry' task. This task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the user to the 'Scoring' task. The 'Scoring' task, upon completion, sends the results to the 'Scoring result obtained' task, which then connects to the 'Follow-up' task. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring' task also sends the results to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, upon completion, sends the results to the 'Other work' task. Simultaneously, the 'Request request' task connects to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task.

After the 'Scoring result obtained' task is completed, the user is directed to the 'Final result finished and override' task, which concludes the process by sending the results to the 'EndEvent0'.
