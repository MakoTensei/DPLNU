 In the system, a scoring process is initiated when the 'Schufscoring\nnot available' event occurs, triggering the 'Delay sales report' task. This task is then forwarded to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn sends the 'Delay sales report' to the 'Delay' gateway. The 'Delay' gateway then sends the 'Delay sales report' to the 'Delay sales report' task.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent1' event triggers the 'Scoring\nSend result to Bank' task, which sends the 'Scoring mountain range' result to the 'Scoring\nresult?' gateway. This gateway then forwards the result to the 'perform scoring level 2' task and the'sid-49FC20AF-81D4-4A89-AA2A-9A3CB3724DE6' task.

The 'Scoring mountain range' task, upon completion, sends the result to the 'EndEvent0' task. This task is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway1', which then sends the result to the 'Delay sales report' task.

In summary, the system handles the scoring process by initiating it when the 'Schufscoring\nnot available' event occurs, and then managing the flow of tasks and events to ensure the results are sent to the appropriate destinations.
