 In the process of handling a regress case, the workflow begins with the event 'Take notification in Regress', which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to 'Regress?', an exclusive gateway that determines the next step in the process. If the notification in Regress is received, the 'Set process for re-submission' task is initiated, leading to a representation.

Simultaneously, the 'Take notification in Regress' event also triggers the 'Book the entrance' task, which sends a notification to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then forwards the notification to the 'Enter the process' task, which is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway5'.

If the regress case is justified, the 'Objection' event leads to the 'Objection justified?' gateway, which can either result in the 'Finished' task or forward the case to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateways receive notifications from both 'Regress?' and 'Objection' events, and can either close the case or forward it to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway4' gateways receive notifications from both 'EventBasedGateway5' and 'EventBasedGateway5' events, and can either forward the case or send a representation.

Finally, the 'Finished' task is triggered by the 'Objection justified?' event, and the 'forwarded' task is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway5' event.
