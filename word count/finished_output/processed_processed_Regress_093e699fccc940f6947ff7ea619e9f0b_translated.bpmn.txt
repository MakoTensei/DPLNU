 In the financial operations workflow, the process begins with the 'Regress possible' event, which triggers the 'Regress possibility check' task. This task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, the 'Book money' task is initiated by the 'Cash receipt\nReport' event, which also links to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Proceedings' task is activated by the 'Opposition\nReport' event, leading it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Close' event is triggered by 'EventBasedGateway4', resulting in the 'Process\nclosed' task.


The 'possible?' gateway receives the 'Regress possible' event and directs it to'sid-64694055-8F6E-4AB4-9145-77BDBC251B1B' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'justified?' gateway is activated by 'EventBasedGateway4' and sends the 'Regress possibility check' and 'Opposition\nReport' events to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3', respectively. 'ExclusiveGateway2' is the entry point for 'Debt collection\ndispatched' and 'Proceedings', while 'ExclusiveGateway3' is the exit point for 'Process\nclosed'.


In summary, the workflow involves various tasks and gateways that process financial events, such as regressing possibilities, booking money, and proceeding with debt collection, ultimately leading to the closure of the process.
