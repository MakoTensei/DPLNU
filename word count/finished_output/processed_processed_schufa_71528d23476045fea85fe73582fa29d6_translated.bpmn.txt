 Upon receiving a scoring requirement, the system initiates a process to send a scoring request to the appropriate level 1 scoring gateway, which in turn receives the request and sends it to level 2 scoring gateway. Once the scoring level 2 gateway receives the requirement, it performs the scoring and sends a final result to the end result gateway. The end result gateway then sends the final result to the Testing successful gateway, which marks the successful completion of the testing process. The Testing successful gateway also sends the final result to the EndEvent0 gateway, signaling the end of the process.
