 To create a Schufascoring request, initiate the process with the 'Schufascoring\nrequired' start event, which triggers the 'Scoring\narrived' event, indicating that the scoring has been successfully received. This event then leads to the 'Scoring' end event.

In the event of an exception, the 'Exception?' gateway receives the 'StartEvent1' and directs the process to either 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' or 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the exception is reported, the process continues to 'Conduct scoring (level 1)', which then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. From there, the process proceeds to 'Scoring reported' and finally concludes at the 'Scoring' end event.

Alternatively, if the exception is not reported, the process goes through 'ExclusiveGateway1' and then to 'Scoring reported', which concludes at the 'Scoring' end event.

Lastly, to conduct scoring at level 1, initiate the process with the 'StartEvent1' and direct it to 'Conduct scoring (level 1)'. This event then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn leads to 'Scoring reported' and finally concludes at the 'Scoring' end event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Schufascoring\nrequired' event, which can lead to either a successful scoring event or an exception event, each with its own set of subsequent events and outcomes.
