 In the process of scoring requests to the Schufa, a series of events and gateways are involved to ensure a smooth flow of information. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Delay' gateway, leading to 'EndEvent0'. This delay is crucial for handling the incoming request and preparing it for further processing.

Once the delay is complete, the request is forwarded to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' gateway, which then sends the request to the 'Level 1 scoring' process. The 'Level 1 scoring' process, initiated by 'StartEvent1', generates 'Feedback to the bank' and 'EndEvent2'. The feedback is sent back to the bank, providing them with the necessary information to make informed decisions.

Simultaneously, the 'Level 1 scoring' process also triggers the 'Level 2 scoring' process, which is initiated by 'StartEvent1' and leads to 'EndEvent3'. The 'Level 2 scoring' process is responsible for further evaluating the request and providing additional insights to the bank.

In summary, the process of scoring requests to the Schufa involves a series of interconnected events and gateways, starting with the 'StartEvent0' and ending with the 'EndEvent3'. The 'Delay' gateway ensures that the request is properly handled before being forwarded to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' and the 'Level 1 scoring' process. The 'Level 1 scoring' process generates 'Feedback to the bank' and triggers the 'Level 2 scoring' process, which ultimately provides the bank with comprehensive insights to make informed decisions.
