 When a customer enters a restaurant, they are tracked for hunger, which triggers the process of selecting a court. Once the court is selected, the customer proceeds to pay for their meal, which is then picked up by the restaurant staff. The customer then picks up their food, eats it, and their hunger is satisfied, leading to the end of the process.

In this scenario, the process begins with the 'Tracked Hunger' event, where the customer's hunger is monitored. This event triggers the 'Customer is The Series' gateway, which leads to the 'Select a court' task. After selecting a court, the customer proceeds to the 'Pay for' task, where they pay for their meal. The payment is then followed by the 'Pick up Pieper' task, where the restaurant staff picks up the food.

The customer then picks up their food and proceeds to the 'Eat food' task, where they consume their meal. Once the food is eaten, the 'Pieper piept' event is triggered, which leads to the 'Famine' end event, signifying the customer's hunger has been satisfied.

In summary, the process flows as follows:
1. Customer enters the restaurant and is tracked for hunger.
2. Customer selects a court.
3. Customer pays for their meal.
4. Restaurant staff picks up the food.
5. Customer picks up their food.
6. Customer eats their food.
7. Customer's hunger is satisfied, and the process ends.
