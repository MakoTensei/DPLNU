 The process begins with the task of packaging goods, which involves the ParallelGateway5. Once the goods are packaged, the task of providing for collection is initiated, which requires the Pick up offer from 3 freight forwarders. This task is facilitated by ParallelGateway5.

Following the collection, the goods must be shipped, and this task is handled by ParallelGateway5. After the shipment, the task of checking the quantity is carried out by ParallelGateway5.

Once the quantity is checked, the task of completing insurance is initiated, which is facilitated by InclusiveGateway2. After the insurance is completed, the task of filling the package note is carried out by InclusiveGateway2.

The filled package note is then sent to InclusiveGateway3, which in turn sends the package to ParallelGateway4. ParallelGateway4 then sends the shipment of goods completed to the ExclusiveGateway1.

The ExclusiveGateway1 then sends a request for Spediteur, which is facilitated by Gateway 'big crowd?'. The Spediteur is then sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which sends the shipment of goods completed to ParallelGateway4.

Finally, the shipment of goods completed is sent to ParallelGateway4, which sends the shipment of goods completed to the end event.
