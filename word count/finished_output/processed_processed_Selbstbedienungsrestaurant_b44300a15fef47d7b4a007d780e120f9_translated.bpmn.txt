 When a customer named Hungriger arrives, they are directed to the Court of Justice. Upon receiving an order, the customer proceeds to enter their order into the cash system, which then connects them to the 'Enter your order in cash system' process. The cash system, in turn, sends the order to the 'Cash' process, which then triggers the 'Pieper' program. The 'Pieper' program is handed over to the guest, and the 'Koch inform' process is initiated to inform the kitchen. Once the desired grinding time is known, the 'Preparation of meal' process begins. This flow of events ensures a smooth and efficient order processing system for the restaurant.
