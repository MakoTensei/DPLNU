 The process begins with the receipt of a "Regression report" which triggers the "Check regression" task. This task checks if a regression is available and if so, it sets up a new template for the regression.

Once the new template is set up, the "Regression determined" task is triggered. This task then initiates a "VN payment request" to proceed with the payment process.

The "VN payment request" task, upon receiving the new template, triggers the "Incoming payment" task. This task confirms the payment and closes the case.

The "Incoming payment" task then triggers the "Entrance is booked" task, which books the entrance for the case.

The "Entrance is booked" task triggers the "Process delivered to debt collection service provider" task, which forwards the case to the debt collection service provider.

The "Process delivered to debt collection service provider" task triggers the "Opposition justified?" task, which determines if the opposition is justified.

If the opposition is justified, the "Complete the process without result" task is triggered, which finalizes the process without a result.

If the opposition is not justified, the "Case forwarded" task is triggered, which moves the case forward.

The "Case forwarded" task triggers the "Process without result" task, which finalizes the process without a result.

The process ends with the "Process without result" task, which closes the case without a result.
