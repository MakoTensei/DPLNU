 When a case is ready for regression, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure proper handling and resolution. Here's a flow of events:

1. The case is marked as "Case ready for regress" (Start Event).
2. The case is routed to ExclusiveGateway2, which checks if the case requires regressing.
3. If the case needs regressing, it proceeds to ExclusiveGateway4, where a check for payment receipt is performed.
4. If the payment receipt is confirmed, the case is forwarded to ExclusiveGateway5, which handles the payment objection.
5. If the payment objection is raised, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway6, where the invoicing process is initiated.
6. The invoicing process can lead to two outcomes:
   a. If the invoice is successfully processed, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway7, which submits an objection.
   b. If the invoice is not processed, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway5, which handles the payment objection.
7. If the payment objection is resolved, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway4, where the payment transfer to the debt collection service provider is initiated.
8. Once the payment transfer is completed, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway5, which closes the case.
9. If the case is not closed due to payment objection, it is routed to ExclusiveGateway6, where the invoicing process is initiated again.
10. The invoicing process can lead to two outcomes:
    a. If the invoice is successfully processed, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway7, which submits an objection.
    b. If the invoice is not processed, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway5, which handles the payment objection.
11. If the payment objection is resolved, the case is sent to ExclusiveGateway4, where the payment transfer to the debt collection service provider is initiated.
12. Once the payment transfer is completed, the case is sent to
