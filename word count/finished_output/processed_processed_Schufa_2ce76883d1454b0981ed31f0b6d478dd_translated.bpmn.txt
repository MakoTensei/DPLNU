 In the scoring process, the system initiates with a 'StartEvent0' that triggers the 'Transmission\nWait Info' task, which waits for the necessary information before proceeding. Once the information is received, the 'Scoring request\nat Schufa\nsend' task is activated, sending a scoring request to Schufa. Concurrently, the 'Finals\nScoring' task is set to send scoring information to Fontend.

Simultaneously, the 'EventBasedGateway3' receives the 'StartEvent0' and directs the flow to 'Finals\nScoring'. The 'Finals\nScoring' task then sends the scoring information to Fontend and also sends it back to Schufa.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which waits for a 'Result\nalready?' message. Upon receiving this message, the 'Send a message' task is triggered, and the 'EndEvent1' is reached.

The 'Result\nalready?' message is also received by 'ExclusiveGateway2', which sends the flow to 'EndEvent1'. The 'EndEvent1' concludes the process, and the system sends a message back to the initiator.

In summary, the scoring process involves multiple tasks and gateways working together to send scoring requests to Schufa and Fontend, wait for necessary information, and handle the results accordingly.
