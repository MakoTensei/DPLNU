 In the world of scoring, a series of events unfold to ensure that scoring requests are processed and results are reported accurately. Let's dive into the flow of these events, involving various tasks, gateways, and their interactions.

The process begins with the 'Schufascoring requested' event, which triggers the first task, 'Add a message'. This task is responsible for sending a message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is also the gateway for the 'Scoring result available?' event. The 'Scoring result available?' event is then triggered by the 'Scoring request made available' event, and it receives the message from 'Add a message' task.

Once the 'Scoring result available?' event is triggered, it sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for performing scoring level 1 and level 2. The 'perform scoring level 1' task sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3', and the 'perform scoring level 2' task also sends a message to the same gateway.

Upon receiving the messages from both tasks, 'ExclusiveGateway3' processes the scoring requests and sends the 'Scoring result reported' event to the 'Scoring result reported' task. This task, in turn, sends the 'Scoring result obtained' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which triggers the 'Scoring result available?' event.

The 'Scoring result available?' event then sends the 'Scoring result obtained' message to the 'Scoring result reported' task, which completes the process by sending the final 'Scoring result reported' event.

In summary, the flow of events and tasks in this scoring process involves the following steps:

1. 'Schufascoring requested' event triggers 'Add a message' task.
2. 'Add a message' task sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
3. 'Scoring request made available' event triggers 'Scoring result available?' event.
4. 'Scoring result available?' event sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway3' processes scoring requests and sends 'Scoring result reported' event
