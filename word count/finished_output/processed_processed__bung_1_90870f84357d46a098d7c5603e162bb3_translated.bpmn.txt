 The process begins with the 'Product required' event, which triggers the 'Pick up the offer of 3 carriers' task. This task is initiated by the 'ParallelGateway4' and leads to the selection of 3 carriers. Following this, the 'Big crowd?' event is triggered, which in turn initiates the '1 selection' task. This task is facilitated by 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then leads to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task is triggered by 'Big crowd?' and subsequently leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Specialist' task also triggers the 'Complete insurance' task, which is facilitated by 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task is initiated by the 'Insurance necessary?' event and leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

After the 'Complete insurance' task, the 'Packaging goods' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4', which leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Provide goods for collection' task is then initiated by 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to the final 'Goods Shipping' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Product required' event, leading to the selection of carriers, followed by a series of tasks and gateways that ensure the necessary insurance is completed and goods are packaged and shipped. The process ends with the 'Goods Shipping' event.
