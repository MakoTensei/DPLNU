 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'clarification, who takes delivery' task. This task is facilitated by the ExclusiveGateway0, which has incoming connections from ParallelGateway6. The task then proceeds to ExclusiveGateway1, which has incoming connections from ExclusiveGateway0.

ParallelGateway7, which is connected to ExclusiveGateway1, is responsible for the 'Ordering Spediteur 1' task. This task is triggered by the 'Insurance close' event, which is connected to ExclusiveGateway1.

The 'Ordering Spediteur 1' task is followed by the 'Order Spediteur 2' and 'Order Spediteur 3' tasks, both of which are connected to ExclusiveGateway1.

The 'Order Spediteur 1' task is followed by the 'Filling out the standardised parcel certificate for postal shipment' task, which is connected to ExclusiveGateway0. This task is triggered by the 'Insurance required?' event, which is connected to ExclusiveGateway0.

The 'Filling out the standardised parcel certificate for postal shipment' task is followed by the 'Packaging goods' task, which is connected to ParallelGateway6.

The 'Packaging goods' task is followed by the 'Goods provided for collection' task, which is connected to ParallelGateway7. This task is followed by the 'EndEvent0' task, which is connected to ParallelGateway7.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'EndEvent0' event.
