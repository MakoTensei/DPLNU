 When an order comes in, it triggers a series of tasks and interactions between different gateways and specialists to ensure the order is processed correctly. The process begins with the 'Order comes from' event, which initiates the following sequence:

1. The order is received, and the 'Order comes from' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the insurance requirements.
2. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the order to the 'Complete insurance' task, which fills out the necessary insurance details for the package.
3. Once the insurance is complete, the 'Complete insurance' task sends the order to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to continue the process.
4. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the order and sends it to the 'ParallelGateway5' for further processing.
5. The 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the order to the 'Check quantity' task to verify the number of items in the order.
6. After confirming the quantity, the 'Check quantity' task sends the order to the 'Packaging goods' task.
7. The 'Packaging goods' task packages the items and sends the order to the 'Provide goods for collection' task.
8. Finally, the 'Provide goods for collection' task prepares the goods for collection and sends the 'Goods are ready for collection' event, signaling the completion of the order processing.

In summary, the order processing flow involves the 'Order comes from' event triggering a series of tasks and interactions between gateways and specialists, ultimately leading to the 'Goods are ready for collection' event.
