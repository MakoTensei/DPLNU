 In the logistics process, various tasks and gateways work together to ensure the smooth handling of goods. The process begins with the 'Shipment' start event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. This task has two outgoing paths: one leading to 'ParallelGateway5' and the other to 'EndEvent0'. 

The 'Packaging goods' task also has incoming paths from 'Shipment' and 'Goods ready for collection'. The 'Goods ready for collection' task has a single outgoing path to 'EndEvent0'. 

The 'ParallelGateway5' task receives incoming paths from 'Packaging goods' and 'Quantity'. It has an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Quantity' task, on the other hand, has incoming paths from 'Packaging goods' and 'Choose the cheapest offer', and it also has an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task has incoming paths from 'Choose the cheapest offer', 'Complete insurance', and 'Packaging goods'. It has an outgoing path to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Complete insurance' task has an incoming path from 'clarification insurance' and an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'clarification insurance' task has incoming paths from 'Packaging goods' and outgoing paths to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task has incoming paths from 'Packaging goods' and 'ParallelGateway4', and it has an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' task has an incoming path from 'Packaging goods' and an outgoing path to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' task has incoming paths from 'Quantity' and 'Packaging goods' and an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
