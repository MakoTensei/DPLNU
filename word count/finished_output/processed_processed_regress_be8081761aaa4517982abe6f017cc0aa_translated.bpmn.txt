 Upon receiving a powerful regression report, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. First, it checks if the regression is authorized, which triggers an exclusive gateway. If authorized, the system proceeds to send payment requests to Vietnam. Concurrently, a process for resubmission is set up, leading to a date of expiry. The resubmission process then connects to an exclusive gateway, which in turn processes the resubmission and sends a notification to the head of the association.


Meanwhile, if the regression is not authorized, the system sends payment requests to Vietnam and connects to an exclusive gateway. This gateway then checks if an objection from Vietnam has been received. If an objection is present, the system closes the case and proceeds to the head of the association.


In the case of an authorized regression, the system also checks for objections from Vietnam. If an objection is received, the system closes the case and proceeds to the head of the association.


Additionally, the system handles cash receipts from Vietnam by sending them to an exclusive gateway, which then connects to the process for resubmission.


The sequence concludes when the process for resubmission reaches the head of the association, marking the end of the event.
