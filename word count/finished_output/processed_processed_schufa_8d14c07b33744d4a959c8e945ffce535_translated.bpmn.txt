 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Delay message\nobtained' gateway, which then sends a 'Delay message\nobtained' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway, upon receiving the 'Send scoring inquiry to Schufa' task, forwards the 'Scoring result\nobtained' to the 'Send scoring result' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring request\nobtained' task triggers the 'Report delay' task, which in turn sends a '1 min' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway, upon receiving the 'perform first scoring (level 1)' task, sends the 'Send scoring result' task to the 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'EventBasedGateway3' receives the 'Scoring request\nobtained' task and sends a '1 min' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway also sends an 'EndEvent0' to the 'Send scoring result' task.

In summary, the process involves a series of tasks and gateways that work together to send a scoring inquiry to Schufa, obtain the scoring result, and handle any delays that may occur during the process.
