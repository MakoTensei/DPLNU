 Let's reframe the flow of tasks and events into a more natural and descriptive narrative:

1. The user experiences hunger, triggering the event 'Hunger'.
2. The system responds by guiding the user to 'Select a court' to place their order.
3. The user selects a court, and the system prompts them to 'Add your order'.
4. The user adds their order, and the system prepares the meal, leading to the event'meal ordered'.
5. The meal is now ready, and the system notifies the user that the meal is ready.
6. The user is then directed to 'Take your order' to finalize the process.
7. The user takes their order, and the system prepares to pay and pick up the meal.
8. The user pays for the meal, and the system confirms the payment, leading to the event 'Cash and hand out Pieper'.
9. The system hands over the Pieper to the user, and the user experiences satisfaction, triggering the event 'Famine'.
10. The user's hunger is satisfied, and the order is completed, leading to the event 'Order completed'.

Additionally, there are gateways that manage the flow of events:

- 'ExclusiveGateway0' is activated when the meal is ready or when the user's hunger is satisfied, leading to the completion of the order.
- 'EventBasedGateway1' is triggered when the user experiences hunger or when the meal is ready, directing the user to either select a court or take their order.

Starting and ending events are also defined:

- The process begins with the user experiencing hunger ('Hunger').
- The process ends with the user's hunger being satisfied ('Famine') or the order being completed ('Order completed').
