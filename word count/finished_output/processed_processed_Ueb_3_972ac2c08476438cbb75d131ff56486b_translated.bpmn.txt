 The process begins with a 'Regression possibility submitted' event, which triggers a 'Send a message' task. This message is sent to inquire about the possibility of a regression. If the possibility is given, the process moves to the 'Set process to WV' task, which is dependent on the 'Opposition arrived' event. The 'Opposition arrived' event is triggered by the 'Regression possibility submitted' event.

If the possibility is not given, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. This task is dependent on the 'Check regression' event and leads to a 'Process unsuccessful completed' outcome if the examination is unsuccessful.

If the possibility is given, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway4' event. This task leads to a 'Process in debt collection forwarded' outcome if the opposition arrives.

If the possibility is not given, the process moves to the 'EventBasedGateway4' task, which is dependent on the 'possibility given?' event. This task leads to a 'justified?' outcome if the possibility is justified.

If the possibility is justified, the process moves to the 'forward to the Inkasso-DL' task, which is dependent on the 'justified?' event. This task leads to a 'Process successful completed' outcome if the money is received.

If the possibility is not justified, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which is dependent on the 'Check regression' event. This task leads to a 'Process unsuccessful completed' outcome if the examination is unsuccessful.

If the possibility is given and justified, the process moves to the 'forward to the Inkasso-DL' task, which is dependent on the 'justified?' event. This task leads to a 'Process successful completed' outcome if the money is received.

The process ends with a 'Process successful completed' outcome if the money is received, or a 'Process unsuccessful completed' outcome if the examination is unsuccessful.
