 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural description, using the names and connections between tasks:

1. The guest feels hungry, triggering the task to add their order.
2. The guest selects a restaurant, prompting the task to pick up the pieper (a server).
3. The guest places their order, leading to the task of retrieving the guest.
4. The kitchen receives the cooking order, initiating the preparation of the meal.
5. The guest is informed about the meal preparation, and the employees are notified to process the cooking order.
6. Once the meal is ready, the guest is notified and the task of famine (hunger) is completed.
