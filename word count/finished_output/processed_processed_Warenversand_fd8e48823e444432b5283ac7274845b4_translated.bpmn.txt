 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' task, which triggers the '3 offers for freight forwarders' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to '3 offers for freight forwarders' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The '3 offers for freight forwarders' task then connects to 'Appoint forwarding', which is linked to 'Special shipment?' at 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This connection allows for the 'Appoint forwarding' task to proceed.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping goods' task also leads to 'Pick up offers from 3 forwardings' at 'Special shipment?', which is connected to 'Pick up offers from 3 forwardings'. This task is essential for obtaining offers from freight forwarders.

Once the 'Appoint forwarding' task is completed, it connects to 'Filling the package note' at 'InclusiveGateway2', which then leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Filling the package note' task is also connected to 'Clearing the shipping mode' at 'InclusiveGateway2', which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'InclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task is responsible for delivering the goods, and it connects to 'Goods are picked up' at 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is the final step in the process, marking the completion of the shipping process.

In summary, the shipping process involves obtaining offers from freight forwarders, appointing forwarding, filling the package note, clearing the shipping mode, and finally delivering the goods. The process is interconnected through various gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient flow of tasks.
