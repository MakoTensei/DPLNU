 In a scoring process, the task 'Check the results' (sid-127D0A33-13FC-4BE6-9374-74E0C977696F) is triggered by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' (sid-A8CA418C-12E5-4AA4-95EF-4109279C1705) and awaits confirmation of the 'Final result delivered?' (sid-451BF53D-6404-44EA-B20A-E437240FA3F1). This task is initiated by 'StartEvent1' (sid-42B96E1D-323D-4C5C-9860-C06945786176) and is followed by 'perform scoring level1' (sid-0A734E6A-28C4-4E0C-AF13-318DEA94D89B), which concludes with 'EndEvent1' (sid-E132C8F3-9A86-4470-8AD8-FA896BADF11D). Subsequently, 'perform scoring level2' (sid-B87E2A43-E465-4145-A0DA-38FFC641AE8A) is executed, leading to 'EndEvent2' (sid-4F690F1B-E77F-44A8-8E6C-DC8EE1895E2C). The 'Is the final result fixed?' (sid-3F12F39A-8A6C-4CE1-9500-34A09E6DA980) task is also initiated by 'StartEvent1' and concludes with 'EndEvent1' and'sid-EC578644-E38E-4A31-94CC-4B9D60477
