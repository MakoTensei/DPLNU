 The process begins with the event 'VN may be taken in regress', which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This message is then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn leads to the 'Check Case' task. If the case is justified, the process moves to 'Objection justified?' task, which then leads to the 'Close' task.

Simultaneously, the 'WV set' task is triggered by the 'Regress possible?' event. This task sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'Money received' task. The 'Money received' task then sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'Book the entrance' task.

The 'Book the entrance' task, upon completion, triggers the 'Closed' task. Concurrently, the 'WV-Frist expired' event leads to the 'Process transferred to collection' task.

In summary, the process involves a series of tasks and gateways that handle the case of 'VN may be taken in regress'. The process starts with sending a message, checking the case, and potentially closing it. Meanwhile, the 'WV set' task handles the money received and books the entrance. The process ends with either closing the case or transferring the debt service provider to collection.
