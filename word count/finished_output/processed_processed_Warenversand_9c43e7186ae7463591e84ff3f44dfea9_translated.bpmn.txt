 When a customer inquires about shipping goods, the process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the '3 offers' task. This task leads to a parallel pathway where the customer is asked if a big crowd is expected. If the answer is yes, the process flows to the 'Insurance close' task, which then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway further directs the process to 'Filling the package note' task, which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the customer does not expect a big crowd, the process moves to the 'Select a quote' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then leads to the 'order a freight forwarder' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

In both scenarios, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to the 'Delivering goods' task. This task concludes the process with the 'Goods delivered' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Shipping goods' event, which branches into two paths based on whether a big crowd is expected. Both paths ultimately converge at 'ParallelGateway5', leading to the 'Delivering goods' task and ending with the 'Goods delivered' event.
