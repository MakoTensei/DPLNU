 When a customer enters the restaurant and expresses hunger, the system triggers the 'Hunger!' start event. This leads to the 'to choose from' task, which presents the customer with a selection of food options. Once the customer selects a meal, the 'Receive your order' start event is activated, initiating the 'Enter your order in the cash register system' task to record the order.

Simultaneously, the 'Receive your order' start event also triggers the 'Preparation of meal' task, which begins the process of preparing the chosen meal. The 'Food' task, which represents the selected meal, is connected to the 'EndEvent0' end event, signifying the completion of the food preparation.

Meanwhile, the 'Waiting for customers' gateway event is triggered by the 'Hunger!' start event, leading to the 'Waiting for customers' task. This task is responsible for managing the queue of customers waiting to place their orders.

Once the customer's order is received, the 'Call Customer' task is triggered, which connects to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' gateway event. This event handles the communication between the cashier and the customer, ensuring that the order is correctly placed and processed.

After the order is placed, the 'Enter your order in the cash register system' task sends the order to the 'EndEvent1' end event, marking the completion of the order placement process.

The 'Preparation of meal' task, upon completion, sends the order to the 'EndEvent2' end event, indicating that the meal is ready for serving.

In summary, the system handles customer hunger by presenting food options, recording orders, preparing meals, and managing customer queues, all while ensuring smooth communication between the cashier and the customer.
