 The process begins with the 'Process start' event, which initiates the scoring inquiry to Schufa, sending a 'Report of Schufa' to the 'Delay?' gateway. Upon receiving the 'Report of Schufa', the 'Delay?' gateway forwards the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Level 1 Scoring' task then receives a 'Scoring request' and proceeds to complete the Level 1 scoring, sending a 'Level 1 successful?' message to the 'Level 1 successful?' gateway.

The 'Level 1 successful?' gateway receives the message and sends a 'Process completed' event, which triggers the 'Transfer Level 1 result to Bank' task. This task completes the transfer and sends a 'Process completed' event.

Next, the 'Result Level 2 Report to Bank' task receives the 'Level 1 successful?' message and completes the Level 2 scoring, sending a 'Process completed' event. The 'Result Level 2 Report to Bank' task then sends a 'Process completed' event, completing the entire process.
