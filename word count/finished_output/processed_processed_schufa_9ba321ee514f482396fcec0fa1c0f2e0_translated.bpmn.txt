 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the forwarding of results to the Frontend. This is achieved through the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' gateway, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'perform scoring level 1' task is then executed, sending a message to 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'perform scoring level 2' task follows, forwarding the result to 'ParallelGateway3'. Concurrently, the 'Send a message Delay to Scoring System' task is executed, also sending a message to 'ParallelGateway3'. Finally, the 'Send Scoring result to Bank' task is performed, sending the scoring result to the Bank via 'ParallelGateway3'. The process concludes with the 'Scoring' event, which is triggered by the 'forwarding delay to frontend' event and results in the 'Scoring ends' event.
