 When a possible regression is detected, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, a payment request is sent to Vietnam, which is handled by ExclusiveGateway2. If the reimbursement period is determined to be possible, the system proceeds to set a case for resubmission, which is also managed by ExclusiveGateway2. Concurrently, the system books the entrance for the case, which is another task directed towards ExclusiveGateway2.


Meanwhile, the system also monitors for objections received, which are directed to ExclusiveGateway3, leading to the case being handed over to the debt collection service provider. Additionally, if the reimbursement period expires, the case is again directed to ExclusiveGateway3.


Throughout this process, the system also handles other events such as booking the entrance, proceeding with the case, and closing the process once the money is received. The system ensures that all incoming and outgoing tasks are managed efficiently through the appropriate gateways, maintaining a smooth workflow and ensuring that each task is handled by the correct pathway.
