 When goods are sent, the process begins with the 'Clear shipping processing' task, which is triggered by the 'Goods are sent' start event. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5' and leads to the '3 offers' task. The '3 offers' task then connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn triggers the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task is linked to the 'Insurance required?' gateway, which further connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Check insurance' task, which is triggered by 'Big crowd?', also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Both 'Complete insurance' and 'Check insurance' tasks lead to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

After the insurance process, the 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to the 'ParallelGateway5', which then triggers the 'Product is provided' end event. This end event signifies the successful completion of the process, where the goods are provided to the customer.
