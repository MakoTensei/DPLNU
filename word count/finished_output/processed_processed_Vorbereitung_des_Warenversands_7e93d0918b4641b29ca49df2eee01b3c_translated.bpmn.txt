 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the pickup of offers for freight forwarders. This leads to the 'Select your offer' task, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then directs the process to the 'Complete insurance' task, ensuring the necessary insurance for the goods.

Following the insurance completion, the process moves to the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which is essential for documenting the contents of the package.

After the package note is filled, the process proceeds to the 'Determining the shipping mode' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' again. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then directs the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

Finally, the process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' task, which is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway5' and signifies the completion of the entire process.
