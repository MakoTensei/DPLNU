 When a shipment is initiated, the process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' start event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'Specialist' service through the 'Special shipment required?' incoming event. The 'Specialist' service then connects back to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' through the same incoming event.

At the 'ExclusiveGateway0', the incoming event 'Special shipment required?' determines whether insurance is necessary. If it is, the 'Determining the insurance requirement' task is triggered, which connects to 'ParallelGateway4' through the 'Insurance necessary?' incoming event. If insurance is not necessary, the 'Pick up offers' task connects to 'ParallelGateway4' through the 'ParallelGateway3' outgoing event.

The 'ParallelGateway4' then connects to the 'Packaging goods' task through the 'ParallelGateway3' incoming event. After packaging, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is triggered, which connects to the 'EndEvent0' through the 'ParallelGateway4' outgoing event.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. 'Goods are to be shipped' start event triggers 'Pick up offers' task.
2. 'Pick up offers' task connects to 'Specialist' service through 'Special shipment required?' event.
3. 'Specialist' service connects back to 'ExclusiveGateway0' through the same event.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway0' determines if insurance is necessary and triggers 'Determining the insurance requirement' task or 'Packaging goods' task accordingly.
5. 'Determining the insurance requirement' task connects to 'ParallelGateway4' through 'Insurance necessary?' event.
6. 'Packaging goods' task connects to 'ParallelGateway4' through 'ParallelGateway3' event.
7. 'Provide goods for collection' task connects to 'EndEvent0' through 'ParallelGateway4' event.
