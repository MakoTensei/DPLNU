 Let's walk through the process of entering a restaurant and enjoying a meal, step by step:

1. You start feeling hungry, so you decide to enter the restaurant.
2. Upon entering, you select a court (or table) to sit at.
3. The restaurant staff takes your order, and you're asked to pay for it.
4. After paying, you receive your food, which in this case is a pie.
5. You enjoy eating the pie.
6. Once you're done eating, the restaurant staff hands you the pie.
7. You submit your order, and the restaurant processes it.
8. The restaurant prepares your meal, and it's ready to be served.
9. The meal is served to you, and you enjoy it.
