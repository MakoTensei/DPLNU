 The process begins with the 'Shipping of goods' event, which triggers the '3 offers' task. This task involves determining the quantity of goods to be shipped, which is received from the 'Wanted size?' gateway. The determined quantity is then selected, and the '1 selection' task is initiated. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which further leads to the 'Run shipping' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping of goods' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which receives input from the 'Wanted size?' gateway. This task is then passed to the 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn leads to the 'Order goods for collection' task.

The 'Insurance?' event, triggered by the 'Shipping of goods' event, leads to the 'Insurance close' task. This task is connected to the 'Run shipping' task, ensuring that the goods are insured before they are shipped.

In summary, the process involves determining the quantity of goods, selecting the appropriate quantity, filling the package note, packaging the goods, and ensuring insurance before the goods are shipped.
