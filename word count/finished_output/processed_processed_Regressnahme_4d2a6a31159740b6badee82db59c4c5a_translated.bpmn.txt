 The process begins with a 'Regression check' event, which triggers a 'Payment\ncreate a request' task. This task is then routed to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'Book the entrance' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression check' event also triggers an 'Opposition' event. This event is directed to the 'EventBasedGateway3', which subsequently leads to the 'Opposition\njustified?' task.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' also receives a 'Reimbursement status' event, which routes to the 'Payment' task. This task then leads to the 'Book the entrance' task.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' also triggers a '14 days' event, which leads to the 'Transfer process' task.

Finally, all the tasks and events are closed, marking the end of the process.
