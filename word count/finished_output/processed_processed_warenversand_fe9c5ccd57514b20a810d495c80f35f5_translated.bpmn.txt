 The process begins with the event 'Goods must be shipped', which triggers the Secretariat to collect offers. This leads to the Secretariat creating a package and selecting a forwarder. The offer creation process involves Spediteur 1, Spediteur 2, and Spediteur 3, all of which are linked to ParallelGateway4. The Secretariat then reviews these offers and selects a forwarder, which is ExclusiveGateway3.

ParallelGateway4 receives offers from Spediteur 1, Spediteur 2, and Spediteur 3, and forwards them to ExclusiveGateway3. Meanwhile, the Secretariat commissions forwarding and creates a package.

The Secretariat then asks whether the shipment is a small or large quantity, which is answered by ParallelGateway6. This information is used to determine the type of shipment and the appropriate forwarder, ExclusiveGateway3.

ParallelGateway6 receives the shipment details and forwards them to ExclusiveGateway3. The goods are then provided for collection, and the process concludes with the shipment being shipped.

In summary, the process involves the Secretariat collecting offers, creating a package, selecting a forwarder, reviewing offers, commissioning forwarding, determining the shipment size, and finally shipping the goods.
