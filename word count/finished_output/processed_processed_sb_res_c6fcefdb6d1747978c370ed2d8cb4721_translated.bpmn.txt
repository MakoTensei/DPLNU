 A guest feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they select a court to place their order. The order is then added to the cart, and the kitchen is notified to prepare the meal. While waiting, the guest is served with a Pieper (a type of food). Once the meal is ready, the guest collects their food and leaves the restaurant. The event-based gateway processes the milled order and directs the guest to the next event, which is the retrieval of the guest after a 5-minute wait. The guest is then served their meal, and the event-based gateway triggers the end of the event, marking the completion of the guest's experience.
