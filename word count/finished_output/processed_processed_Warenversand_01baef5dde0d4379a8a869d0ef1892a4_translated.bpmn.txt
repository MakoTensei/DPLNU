 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the packaging of goods. This task is then passed to 'Task3', which is responsible for the packaging process. Once the goods are packaged, they are sent to 'ExclusiveGateway0' for further processing.

At 'ExclusiveGateway0', the goods are requested for a quote, which is then passed to 'Select your offer'. The selected offer is then passed to the 'Specialist' for further processing. The 'Specialist' then completes the insurance for the goods and sends them to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for final packaging.

After the goods are filled in the package note, they are sent to 'ParallelGateway3' for delivery. The 'ParallelGateway3' receives the goods from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway1' and delivers the goods to the customer.

In summary, the process starts with the shipping of goods, followed by packaging, requesting a quote, selecting an offer, completing insurance, filling the package note, and finally delivering the goods to the customer.
