 The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent', which triggers the 'Clear the amount' task, utilizing the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is then followed by 'Filling the package note' to ensure the package is properly documented, which is handled by 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Next, 'Select and order freight forwarders' is initiated, leading to 'ExclusiveGateway3' as well. Concurrently, 'Complete insurance' is processed through 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is determined by the 'Insurance necessary?' query. Once the insurance is confirmed, 'Provide goods for collection' is executed via 'ParallelGateway5', and finally, the goods are dispatched, marking the end of the process with 'Goods ready for dispatch'.
