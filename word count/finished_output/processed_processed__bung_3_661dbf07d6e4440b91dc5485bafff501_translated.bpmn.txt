 The process begins with the 'Regression report' triggering the 'Regression claim?' gateway, which then leads to the creation of a 'Recovery template' to set up a payment request for Vietnam. This is followed by the 'Regression claim?' being processed through the 'Revocation of the UN' gateway, resulting in a 'Disclosure of debt' action. Concurrently, the 'Date of expiry' event from the 'EventBasedGateway2' triggers the 'Disclosure of debt collection' process.


Once the 'Reasons' are provided through the 'EventBasedGateway2', the 'Reasons' gateway closes the process. The 'Get money' gateway, which is triggered by the 'Recovery template', also closes the process. Lastly, the 'EventBasedGateway2' closes the process, completing the sequence of events and gateways.
