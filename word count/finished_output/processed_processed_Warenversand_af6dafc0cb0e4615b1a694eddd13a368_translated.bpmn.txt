 When shipping goods, the system initiates the process by picking up offers, specifically looking for large quantities. This triggers the 'Select your offer' task, which then leads to the 'Ordering' task. The 'Ordering' task, in turn, connects to 'ParallelGateway4' for further processing.

Simultaneously, the 'Filling the package note' task is activated, which requires 'ParallelGateway3' as an input and results in 'Goods ready for dispatch' as an output.

The 'Ordering' task also connects to 'ParallelGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway4', while the 'Insurance close' task is triggered by the 'Insurance?' input, leading to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Goods ready for dispatch' as outputs.

The 'Packaging goods' task, which requires 'ParallelGateway3' as an input, results in 'Goods ready for dispatch' as an output.

In summary, the process starts with shipping goods, leading to the selection of offers, ordering, filling the package note, and packaging goods. The goods are then dispatched, and the process ends with the goods being ready for dispatch.
