 In the realm of financial transactions, a series of events unfold, each with its own purpose and outcome. The journey begins with the possibility of a regress, a situation where a debtor may have overpaid. This event, identified by'sid-3BB4CBC4-1A4B-4F41-B418-5AD436714C53', sets the stage for further investigation.

The first gateway,'sid-sid-537B724F-D206-4BDD-B320-F59FA346DEDE', acts as a decision point. It evaluates whether the regress is indeed justified.

The second gateway,'sid-sid-27940465-A35E-4717-B576-4AF6D3B6B11E', is the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. It determines the next course of action based on the previous decision. If the regress is justified, the event 'EventBasedGateway3' is activated, with'sid-sid-5EFB9497-AB28-40DE-9790-62E9699DAD95' as its incoming gateway.
