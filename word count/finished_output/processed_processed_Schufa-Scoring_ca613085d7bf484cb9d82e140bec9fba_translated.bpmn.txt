 In the scoring system, a scoring request initiates the process by sharing the Scoring 1 result. This request is then shared with the IntermediateCatchEvent3 gateway, which in turn shares the Scoring result 1 and reports a delay for Scoring 2. The Scoring result 1 is then shared with the Gateway sid-1C31828C-91C7-42B6-BC2E-0B465B1B6542, which ends the process with EndEvent0 and provides Level 2 information.

Meanwhile, the Scoring request also sends Scoring2 to the Gateway sid-C41A37F3-538C-4AF0-B902-7A958FF0ED74, which determines the Scoring values for Scoring2 and shares them with the EndEvent0 and Level 2 information gateways.

Additionally, the Scoring request can be edited using the Gateway sid-A6465C5C-8CAD-4C3E-82B5-A67A37D31D0B, which reports the edited Scoring results 1.

In summary, the scoring request initiates the process by sharing the Scoring 1 result, which is then shared with the IntermediateCatchEvent3 gateway. The Scoring result 1 is shared with the Gateway sid-1C31828C-91C7-42B6-BC2E-0B465B1B6542, which ends the process with EndEvent0 and provides Level 2 information.
