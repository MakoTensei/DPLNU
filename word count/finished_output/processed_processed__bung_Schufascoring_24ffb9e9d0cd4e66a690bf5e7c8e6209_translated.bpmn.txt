 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'EventBasedGateway1', which then sends a 'Scoring request' to the Schufa. This request is caught by 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which subsequently determines the scoring level and sends the result to'sid-0F5C5079-B1FC-4CCA-A472-312617450A7D'. Following this, 'EventBasedGateway1' also sends 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to'sid-9E18E5AE-D5AB-4F6B-9371-F4ABDA2A66E9'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring (level 1)' process, which is caught by 'Scoring determined?' gateway. This gateway then sends the scoring result to'sid-154D80AF-5302-4729-91D6-52C3FE70E465' and'sid-A304889E-8212-46E7-9578-B07A1A27D66F'.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' concludes the process, receiving the results from both 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'.
