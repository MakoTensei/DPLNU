 The process begins with the 'Goods\nShip' start event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway3' and sending output to 'ParallelGateway2'. Next, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is initiated, also receiving input from 'ParallelGateway3' and outputting to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Select shipping mode' task then takes over, with 'ParallelGateway3' as its input and 'Filling the package note' and 'Request a quote' as its outputs. The 'Filling the package note' task, in turn, sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway1', while 'Request a quote' goes to 'Select a forwarding'. The 'Select a forwarding' task receives input from 'Request a quote' and sends its output to 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'Specialist' task then takes over, receiving input from 'Select a forwarding' and outputting to 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'Insurance close' task is triggered by 'Insurance\nnecessary?', with 'ParallelGateway3' as its input and 'ParallelGateway2' as its output. Finally, the 'EndEvent0' event is triggered, receiving input from 'Insurance close' and 'Provide goods for collection', and having no output.
