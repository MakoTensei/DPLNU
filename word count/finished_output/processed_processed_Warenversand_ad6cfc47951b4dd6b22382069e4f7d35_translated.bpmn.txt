 In the bustling world of logistics and shipping, a series of tasks and gateways work in harmony to ensure that goods are packaged, insured, and shipped efficiently. The journey begins with the 'StartEvent0' and concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.

The process kicks off when 'StartEvent0' triggers the creation of a quote, which is a crucial step in the logistics chain.
