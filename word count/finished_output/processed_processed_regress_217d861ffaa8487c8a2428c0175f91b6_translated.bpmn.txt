 When a possible regression against policyholders is identified, the process begins with the 'Possible regression against policyholders' event. This triggers a 'Send a message' task to notify the relevant parties. The message task then connects to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which determines if a regress is indeed possible. If the gateway confirms a regress, it sends the case for resubmission to the 'Set case for resubmission' task. This task, in turn, connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to proceed with the next steps.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' has two possible outcomes: it can either lead to the 'EndEvent1' or the 'Book money receipt' event. If the case is resolved and money is received, the 'Book money receipt' event is triggered, and the process ends with the 'EndEvent1' event. However, if the case is not resolved, it is handed over to the debt collection service provider, and the process ends with the 'handed over case to debt collection service provider' event.

On the other hand, if the 'Regress possible?' gateway determines that a regress is not possible, the process proceeds to the 'Proceedings' event. The 'Proceedings' event connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which can lead to either the 'EndEvent1' or the 'EventBasedGateway4' event. If the case is resolved and money is received, the 'Book money receipt' event is triggered, and the process ends with the 'EndEvent1' event. However, if the case is not resolved, it is handed over to the debt collection service provider, and the process ends with the 'handed over case to debt collection service provider' event.

In summary, the process starts with the identification of a possible regression against policyholders, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways to determine the outcome and appropriate actions. The process can end with either the resolution of the case and money receipt or the case being handed over to a debt collection service provider.
