 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'StartEvent1' and sends a message to 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway then sends a 'is delay message' to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends a 'Scoring' message to 'Scoring'. The 'Scoring' event then sends a 'is delay message' to 'EventBasedGateway2', which sends a 'Share Scoring result' message to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. This event then sends a 'Scoring request' message to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which sends a 'Scoring' message back to 'Scoring'. The 'Scoring' event then sends a 'EndEvent1' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which sends an 'EndEvent1' message back to 'Scoring'. Finally, the 'Scoring' event sends a 'EndEvent1' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which sends an 'EndEvent1' message back to 'Scoring'.
