 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Send request Schufaservice' task, which then catches the intermediate event 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. This event is responsible for sending the request to the 'Schufascore send reply' task.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1' task, which sends the request to the 'Answer the Schufa request\nnot level1' task. This task, in turn, catches the intermediate event 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and sends a reply back to the 'Schufascore send reply' task.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'StartEvent1' task, which sends the request to the 'Level 1 score' task. This task catches the intermediate event 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and sends a reply back to the 'EventBasedGateway1' task.

The 'Level 1?' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', determines the score level and sends a reply back to the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3' tasks.

The 'Determine Schufascore' task, triggered by 'Return status', receives the score level and sends a reply back to the 'EndEvent3' task.

Finally, the 'EndEvent3' task, triggered by 'Level 1?', concludes the process.
