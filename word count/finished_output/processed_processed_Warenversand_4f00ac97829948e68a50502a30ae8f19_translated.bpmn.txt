 In a bustling warehouse, the process of packaging goods begins with the arrival of goods at ParallelGateway4. The goods are then passed on to ExclusiveGateway2, where the insurance is determined. If insurance is necessary, the goods are directed to EndEvent0. Once the insurance decision is made, the goods are sent to ParallelGateway3 for further processing.

Meanwhile, the warehouse also has a team responsible for providing goods for collection. This process starts at ParallelGateway4 and is directed to ExclusiveGateway2. After the goods are collected, they are sent to EndEvent0.

In another part of the warehouse, the team responsible for completing insurance works diligently. They receive a signal from Insurance necessary? at ParallelGateway4 and proceed to ExclusiveGateway2. Once the insurance is completed, the goods are sent to EndEvent0.

The team in charge of filling the package note also receives goods at ParallelGateway4. They then send the filled package note to ExclusiveGateway2 for further processing.

Recording the process is another crucial task in the warehouse. The team receives a signal from StartEvent0 at ParallelGateway4 and records the process at EndEvent0.

Requesting offers from forwarders is a vital step in the warehouse's operations. The team receives a signal from Quantity >x? at ParallelGateway4 and sends a request to sid-06524A2D-C7F8-4171-B0FC-F0D2B4E8C83B.

Selecting the Spediteur, or the forwarder, is another important task. The team receives a signal from IntermediateCatchEvent5 at ParallelGateway4 and sends the selected Spediteur to Specialist at EndEvent1.

The Specialist team receives signals from IntermediateCatchEvent5 at ParallelGateway4 and EndEvent0 at ExclusiveGateway2. They then complete the process at EndEvent1.

In summary, the warehouse's operations involve various teams and processes, all interconnected
