 The process begins with the 'StartEvent1' where goods are dispatched and the system initiates the pickup process. The 'Pick up offers' task is triggered, which checks for a large quantity of goods. Upon confirmation, the system sends the '3 offers\nReport\nor TimeOut' to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Specialist' is alerted to handle the offers. The 'Specialist' then forwards the offers to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Goods\ndispatched\nthey are' event is triggered, which sends the incoming to both 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the offers to 'ParallelGateway5', while 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the offers to 'ParallelGateway5' as well.

The 'Select your offer' task is activated, where the system selects the offers from 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Specialist' is then informed about the selected offer.

The 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, where the system prepares the package note for the selected offer. The 'Goods\ndispatched\nthey are' event is triggered again, sending the incoming to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Goods\nprovide\n' task is activated, where the system prepares the goods for collection. The 'Goods ready for collection' event is triggered, sending the incoming to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Complete insurance' task is initiated, where the system checks if insurance is necessary for the selected offer. The 'Insurance\nnecessary?' event is triggered, sending the incoming to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Finally, the 'EndEvent1' is triggered, marking the completion of the pickup process. The system sends the 'Pick up goods\nand shipping' event to 'EndEvent1', signaling the end of the process.
