 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and flowing manner, incorporating the names and connections between tasks:

1. The customer feels hungry, triggering the event "Hunger felt."
2. This leads to the task "Add your order," where the customer places their order.
3. The order is then received, prompting the task "Retrieve guest" to bring the customer to the restaurant.
4. The kitchen receives the cooking order, resulting in the task "inform employees" to start preparing the meal.

Start Events:
1. The customer feels hungry, which initiates the process.
2. The customer places their order, leading to the next step.
3. The order is received, and the customer is brought to the restaurant.
4. The kitchen receives the cooking order, and the employees are informed to start preparing the meal.

End Events:
1. The customer's hunger is satisfied, and they no longer feel famished.
2. The order is completed, and the customer is served their meal.
3. The cooking order is finished, and the meal is ready to be served.
