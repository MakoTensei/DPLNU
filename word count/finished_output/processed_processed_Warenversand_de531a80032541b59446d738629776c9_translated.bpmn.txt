 In a complex system, various tasks are interconnected through gateways and events. For instance, the 'Spedition 1' task, which deals with large quantities, initiates from the 'StartEvent0' and is routed through 'ParallelGateway2' to reach 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then forwards the task to 'order selected forwarding'. Concurrently, 'Spedition 2' and 'Spedition 3', both handling large quantities, also start from 'StartEvent0' and are directed to 'ParallelGateway2', which subsequently sends them to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

On the other hand, 'Select your offer' task, which is for small quantities, begins at 'ParallelGateway2' and is routed to 'order selected forwarding'. This task is then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which sends it to the appropriate destination.

The 'Filling it' task, associated with the 'Spedition 1' and 'Spedition 2' tasks, starts at 'ParallelGateway4' and ends at 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, the 'Packaging goods' task, linked to 'Spedition 3', also starts at 'ParallelGateway4' but does not have an outgoing gateway.

In summary, the system manages large and small quantity tasks through a network of gateways and events, ensuring efficient routing and completion of each task.
