 When a 'Regression option available' event occurs, it triggers a 'Send a message' task, which in turn leads to a 'Set process for resubmission' task. This task then connects to an 'ExclusiveGateway3', which further leads to a 'Date of expiry' task. The 'Date of expiry' task then connects back to an 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression option available' event also triggers a 'Book payment receipt' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Send a message' task is also connected to an 'EventBasedGateway4', which can lead to a 'Close' task if the 'EventBasedGateway4' receives a 'Regress?' event. This 'Close' task then connects to an 'ExclusiveGateway3', which finally leads to a 'Closed' task.

In summary, the 'Regression option available' event initiates a chain of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Closed' task.
