 In the process of shipping goods, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Determining the shipping method' task, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then directs the process to 'Filling the package note' and 'Request a quote' tasks. The 'Request a quote' task sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the tasks 'Filling the package note' and 'Request a quote' to their respective outgoing gateways.

Once the quote is received, the 'Select offers' task is initiated, which sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then directs the process to 'Delivering goods' and 'Complete insurance' tasks. The 'Complete insurance' task sends the process to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn sends the process to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then directs the process to 'ParallelGateway4', which sends the goods ready for dispatch to the 'Delivering goods' task. The 'Delivering goods' task then sends the goods to the 'Goods ready for dispatch' task, marking the end of the process.
