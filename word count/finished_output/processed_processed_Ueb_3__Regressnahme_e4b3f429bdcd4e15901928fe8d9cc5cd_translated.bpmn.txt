 The process begins with the event 'Regression possible', which triggers the task 'Check the case' to send a message indicating a possible regression. This message then leads to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which has two possible outcomes: 'Closed\nwithout regression' and 'Closed\nand opposition'.

If the case is closed without regression, the 'Set process for resubmission' task is triggered, which sends a message to the 'EventBasedGateway3'. This gateway then leads to the 'Payment' gateway, resulting in the case being closed with a payment made.

On the other hand, if the case is closed with opposition, the 'Opposition\njustified?' gateway is triggered, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then sends a message to the 'Process of debt service providers\nhand over' task, which is triggered by the 'Representation\nwithout payment\nExpired' event.

In summary, the process starts with a possible regression, leading to different outcomes based on the decision made at the 'Regress possible?' gateway. The outcomes either result in a closed case with payment made or a closed case with opposition and handing over to debt service providers.
