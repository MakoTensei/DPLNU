 The process begins with the 'Goods\nShip' event, which triggers the 'Separation of dispatch processing' task, leading to the 'Check quantity' task. The 'Check quantity' task, in turn, sends outgoing messages to 'Pick up special delivery offers' and 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'ParallelGateway2' task then initiates the 'Preparing mail' task, which sends an outgoing message to 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'Check quantity' task also sends an outgoing message to 'Filling Pact Paper'. The 'Filling Pact Paper' task, which is triggered by the 'Goods\nShip' event, sends an outgoing message to 'Complete insurance' and 'Packaging goods'. The 'Complete insurance' task, which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway2', sends an outgoing message to 'Packaging goods'. Lastly, the 'Packaging goods' task, which is also triggered by 'ParallelGateway2', sends an outgoing message to 'Complete insurance'. This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures the smooth processing of goods dispatch, preparation of mail, and completion of insurance.
