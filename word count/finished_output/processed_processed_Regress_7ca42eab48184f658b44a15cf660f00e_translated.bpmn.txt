 In the system, a notification of possible regression triggers a gateway named "Regress possible?" which then leads to a process of examining the regression. If the examination confirms the regression, the process is closed and the task is marked as "Regress possible?" with no incoming or outgoing connections.

On the other hand, when money is received, it triggers a gateway named "Money received" which leads to a process of closing the task and transferring the money to the debt collection service provider.

When an opposition is received, it triggers an event-based gateway named "Opposition" which leads to a process of proceeding to the debt collection service provider.

Similarly, when a sitting on re-submission occurs, it triggers an event-based gateway named "EventBasedGateway2" which leads to a process of determining if the objection is justified and transferring the money to the debt collection service provider. If the objection is justified, the process is closed.

Lastly, when a reimbursement period is reached, it triggers an event-based gateway named "Reimbursement period" which leads to a process of transferring the money to the debt collection service provider.
