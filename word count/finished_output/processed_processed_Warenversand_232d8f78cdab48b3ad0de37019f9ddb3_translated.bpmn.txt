 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task through the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Filling the package note' task then sends the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which in turn initiates the 'Complete insurance' and'sid-A69B6E3C-37E4-457D-B1AC-5F8981FBD864' task. Concurrently, the 'Goods be sent' event also triggers the 'Packaging goods' task via 'ParallelGateway2', which leads to the'sid-057E7577-DB4D-4906-8D1B-6365C83BC1F7' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Goods be sent' event also initiates the 'Provide goods for collection' task through 'ParallelGateway3', which eventually leads to the 'End' event. The 'Separation of shipping' task is triggered by the'sid-A911EDD6-02BE-4562-A747-67DFD7CD5B36' event, which is sent from 'ParallelGateway3'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, leading to the 'Filling the package note' and 'Packaging goods' tasks. The 'Filling the package note' task further leads to the 'Complete insurance' task. Simultaneously, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is initiated, which eventually leads to the 'End' event. The 'Separation of shipping' task is also triggered during this process.
