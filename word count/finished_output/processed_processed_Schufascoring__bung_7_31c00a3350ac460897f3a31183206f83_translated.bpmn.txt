 In the process of handling a credit award request, the system initiates a series of tasks and interactions between various components and gateways. Here's a natural flow description of the process:

1. The system receives a credit award request and sends a scoring request to Schufa. This task is assigned the ID'sid-sid-DE7DB5E0-EBFC-488F-B75A-3E084BB753E0' and is named 'Send scoring request to the Schufa'. The task has an incoming event 'Credit award request\nwe have discussed' and an outgoing event 'Scoring 1\nResult\narrived'.

2. Schufa processes the scoring request and sends the result back to the system. This task is assigned the ID'sid-sid-B7398AFD-B9F8-407A-BB14-3687F30A794F' and is named 'Redirecting the result'. The task has an incoming event 'Scoring 1\nResult\narrived' and an outgoing event 'Result\nforwarded'.

3. The system receives the scoring result from Schufa and forwards it to the EventBasedGateway1. This task is assigned the ID'sid-sid-4AEF0EF6-02BA-45C6-BA83-41C9417DE3B9' and is named 'Scoring 1\nforward'. The task has an incoming event 'Scoring 1\nResult\narrived' and an outgoing event 'Result\nforwarded'.

4. The EventBasedGateway1 processes the scoring result and forwards it to the ExclusiveGateway0. This task is assigned the ID'sid-sid-CE786780-3B2D-437F-8D1C-3130EBBD67E8' and is named 'Feedback of the scoring result to Schufascoring'. The task has an incoming event 'Scoring 1\nResult\narrived' and an outgoing event
