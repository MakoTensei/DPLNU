 Let's trace the flow of events starting from the 'Regression possibility Report' and ending with the 'Process successful closed' event:

1. The 'Regression possibility Report' is received, triggering the 'Send a message' task.
2. The 'Send a message' task sends a message to'set to WV'.
3. The'set to WV' task sets the case to 'WV-Frist Expired' status.
4. The 'WV-Frist Expired' status triggers the 'Process forwarded' task.
5. The 'Process forwarded' task forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway2' checks if there is an 'Existing Possibility?' and if so, it forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
7. 'ExclusiveGateway3' checks if there is an 'Opposition Obtained' and if so, it closes the case.
8. If there is no 'Opposition Obtained', 'ExclusiveGateway3' forwards the case to 'EventBasedGateway4'.
9. 'EventBasedGateway4' checks if there is an 'Existing Possibility?' and if so, it forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
10. 'ExclusiveGateway2' forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
11. 'ExclusiveGateway3' checks if there is an 'Opposition Obtained' and if so, it closes the case.
12. If there is no 'Opposition Obtained', 'ExclusiveGateway3' forwards the case to 'EventBasedGateway4'.
13. 'EventBasedGateway4' checks if there is an 'Existing Possibility?' and if so, it forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
14. 'ExclusiveGateway2' forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
15. 'ExclusiveGateway3' checks if there is an 'Opposition Obtained'
