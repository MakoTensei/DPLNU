 The process begins with the 'Goods\nShip' event, which triggers the 'Pick up the offer of 3 carriers' task. This task is then followed by the 'Select offers' task, which receives input from the 'Lot?' gateway. The 'Select offers' task then sends its output to the 'Specialist' gateway, which in turn sends its output to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

Next, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered, which receives input from the 'Lot?' gateway and sends its output to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Complete insurance' task follows, which receives input from the 'Insurance required?' gateway and sends its output to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends its output to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Delivering goods' task is triggered, which receives input from the 'ParallelGateway5' and sends its output to the 'Goods\nmade available' event, marking the end of the process.
