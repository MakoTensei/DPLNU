 Let's trace the flow of events starting with the 'Regression possibility submitted' and ending with 'Case successfully closed':

1. 'Regression possibility submitted' triggers 'Send a message' to 'Set case on WV'.
2. 'Set case on WV' checks if the possibility is available, and if so, it sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
3. 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the message and checks if the case is open. If it is, it closes the case and sends a message to 'Case unsuccessful closed'.
4. If the case is not open, 'ExclusiveGateway3' forwards the case to 'EventBasedGateway4'.
5. 'EventBasedGateway4' checks if the possibility is available and if the WV has expired. If the WV has expired, it forwards the case to 'Case forwarded'.
6. If the WV has not expired, 'EventBasedGateway4' sends a message to 'Money received'.
7. 'Money received' triggers 'Book money receipt' which closes the case successfully.

This flow ensures that the case is properly handled from the moment a regression possibility is submitted, through various checks and actions, and finally, the case is closed successfully.
