 In a system designed to handle scoring requests and reporting results, the following sequence of events and gateways are involved:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Delay?' gateway. This gateway determines whether a delay is necessary before proceeding with the scoring process.

2. If a delay is required, the 'Delay?' gateway sends the 'Delay?' event to the 'Scoring 2\nResult arrived' gateway, which then sends the 'Scoring 2\nResult arrived' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the 'Scoring 2\nResult arrived' event and sends the 'EndEvent0' event, signaling the completion of the delay process.

4. Concurrently, the 'Delay?' gateway also sends the 'EndEvent0' event to the 'Report the result' gateway, which then sends the 'EndEvent0' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'EndEvent0' event and sends the 'Level 2\nnecessary?' event to the 'Level 2 scoring' gateway.

6. The 'Level 2 scoring' gateway receives the 'Level 2\nnecessary?' event and sends the 'Scoring 2 results' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Scoring 2 results' event and sends the 'EndEvent1' event, signaling the completion of the scoring process.

8. The 'StartEvent1' triggers the 'Level 2\nnecessary?' gateway, which sends the 'Level 2\nnecessary?' event to the 'Scoring 2 results' gateway.

9. The 'Scoring 2 results' gateway receives the 'Level 2\nnecessary?' event and sends the 'EndEvent1' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

10. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'EndEvent1' event, completing the entire process.

In summary, the system handles scoring requests by initiating a delay process
