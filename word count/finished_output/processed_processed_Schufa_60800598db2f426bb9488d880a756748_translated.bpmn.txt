 In the workflow, a scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway directs the process to either 'EventBasedGateway2' or 'Result'. If the process goes through 'EventBasedGateway2', it will forward the scoring results to 'EndEvent0' and also send an intermediate catch event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event then sends a delay notice to the sales staff.

The 'Scoring request' initiates the process by sending a request to 'Result'. The 'Result' gateway then forwards the scoring request to two outcomes:'sid-1A253908-B8F3-42E7-B6E2-9FF7336B8CCD' and'sid-0E725AF4-72F2-436F-98A2-E10A8CA11BF6'.

The 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' process starts with a 'Scoring request' and ends with a 'Result'. This process is forwarded to 'EndEvent0' through 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'.

The 'Level 2 scoring' process begins with a 'Scoring request' and sends the results to'sid-3F302477-A90F-4972-9770-972D132E4C3D'.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0', which can either go to 'EventBasedGateway2' or 'Result'. If it goes through 'EventBasedGateway2', it will forward the results to 'EndEvent0' and send a delay notice to the sales staff. The 'Scoring request' process is conducted in two levels, with the first level sending the results to 'EndEvent0' and the second level sending the results to'sid-3F302477-A90F-4972-9770-972D132E4C3D'.
