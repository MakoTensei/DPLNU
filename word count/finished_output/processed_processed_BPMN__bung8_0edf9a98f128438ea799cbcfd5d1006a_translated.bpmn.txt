2. The guest triggers the "Get Pieper" action, which leads to the preparation of food.

5. The "Leave food" action completes the order and connects to the "Guest coming" event, which then connects to the "Order completed" event.

Gateways:

1. The "Guest coming" event connects to the "EventBasedGateway0" gateway, which then connects to the "Leave food" action.
