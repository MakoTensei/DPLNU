 When a regression is checked, the system evaluates whether the regression is justified or not. If it's not justified, the process is directed to ExclusiveGateway3, where the decision to close the regression process is made. Concurrently, if the regression is justified, the process continues to Proceedings, which eventually leads to the closing of the regression process.

If a payment request is sent to Vietnam, the system checks for opposition. If there is opposition, the process is directed to ExclusiveGateway4, which leads to the date of issue.

When a payment is made, the system checks for the right to regression. If the right to regression is not present, the process is directed to ExclusiveGateway3.

The EventBasedGateway5 is triggered when there is a right to regression. This gateway can lead to the payment being made, the procurement of debtors, or the closing of the regression process.

In summary, the system handles regression checks, payment requests, and opposition through a series of interconnected gateways and processes, ultimately leading to the closure of the regression process or the issuance of a date.
