 When a Schufa request is obtained, the process begins with the Gateway named "Scoring?", which receives the incoming request and sends a "Schufascoring send" message to the "Schufascoring" gateway. This triggers the "Level 1 scoring perform" task, which then sends a "Schufascoring send" message to the "Schufascoring" gateway. Simultaneously, the "Level 2 scoring perform" task is initiated, which sends a "Schufascoring send" message to the "Schufascoring" gateway and also sends a "Delay Message obtained" message to the "EventBasedGateway1". The "Schufascoring send" message is then sent from the "Schufascoring" gateway to the "Schufascoring send" endpoint, marking the end of the process.
