 In the scoring process, a StartEvent0 initiates the sequence, triggering a Scoring request that leads to a Scoring event. This event then forwards the scoring to a Score forward event. Concurrently, two scoring levels are performed: Level 1 by a perform scoring (Lv1) event, which sends the request to a Normal verb.? event, and Level 2 by a Scoring (Lv 2) event, which sends the request to a ParallelGateway1. The ParallelGateway1 then directs the request to perform scoring (Lv 2) and ParallelGateway2. Meanwhile, the ParallelGateway2 receives requests from both ParallelGateway1 and StartEvent0, and ultimately submits the results. Additionally, a Report delay event is triggered by ParallelGateway1, which sends the results to ParallelGateway2. Finally, the Submitting results event, which receives inputs from both Normal verb.? and Request request, concludes the scoring process.
