 The court selection process begins with the customer feeling hunger, triggering the event 'Hunger felt' with no incoming or outgoing connections. This event leads to the customer adding their order, which is connected to the 'Add your order' gateway.

The order is then processed, and the customer receives their order, initiating the 'Order received' event. This event connects to the 'EventBasedGateway0', which is responsible for handling the 'Message from Koch' event. The 'Message from Koch' event informs the customer that they will appear at the issue, leading to the 'Customer will appear at the issue' event.

Once the customer arrives at the issue, the 'Issued' event is triggered, which is connected to the 'inform employees' event. The employees are informed about the customer's arrival, and the food collection process begins.

The 'Waiting period' event is triggered, connecting to the 'Food collected' event. This signifies that the customer has waited for their food and it is now ready to be collected.

Finally, the 'Food collected' event is connected to the 'Issued' event, completing the process and indicating that the customer has received their food.
