 Starting with the event 'Goods dispatched they are' (sid-3B978EC9-D5F9-4130-A9CE-A9E51080F490), the process begins by forwarding the goods through ParallelGateway4 (incoming: [Goods dispatched they are], outgoing: [ParallelGateway4]). This leads to the 'Packaging goods' task (sid-39771404-3E41-4039-BC0B-702EA67E34AC) with the incoming event 'ParallelGateway4' and the outgoing event 'Goods pickup provide'.

Next, the 'Goods pickup provide' event (sid-39771404-3E41-4039-BC0B-702EA67E34AC) triggers the 'Shipping with forwarding' task (sid-F043B3F0-23CE-4C1F-B323-78B76E1BC1AB) with the incoming event 'ParallelGateway6' and the outgoing event 'Goods are Spedition Travelling'.

Simultaneously, the 'Special delivery necessary?' event (sid-AA0D994C-64EF-4300-B7EB-354790E7BC1A) leads to the 'ParallelGateway5' task (sid-2307B9CA-032C-4BC9-AD23-1F6B05EB6B6E) with the incoming events 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Goods dispatched they are' and the outgoing event 'Goods are Post Travelling'.

Finally, the 'Goods are Post Travelling' event (sid-8A88106C-8F58-4610-88AF-F471974384E6) concludes the process, with no incoming or outgoing events.
