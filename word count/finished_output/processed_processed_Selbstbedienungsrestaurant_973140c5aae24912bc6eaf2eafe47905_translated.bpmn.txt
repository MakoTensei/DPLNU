 In response to the event of hunger, the system initiates a sequence to address the need for food. The process begins with selecting a court, specifically the Court of Justice, to handle the case of hunger. Once the court is selected, the system proceeds to pick up food, in this case, a pie from Pieper.

After consuming the pie, the system experiences a feeling of fullness, which is represented by the event 'Famine.' This event is triggered by the consumption of the pie, as indicated by the incoming message 'Pieper piept.'

Simultaneously, the system also records the event of a guest coming, which leads to the retrieval of the guest. This retrieval process is connected to the 'Average after 5 minutes empty' event, which has two outgoing connections: 'Retrieve guest' and 'Order process completed.'

The 'Order process completed' event is triggered by the 'Average after 5 minutes empty' event, which in turn is connected to the 'Food collected' event. This event signifies the completion of the food collection process.

Following the food collection, the system prepares the court and puts it through the cooking process. This preparation is triggered by the 'Order to receive' event, which has an incoming connection from the 'Guest coming' event.

The cooking process is completed, represented by the 'Cooking process completed' event, which has an incoming connection from the 'Preparing the court and putting it through' event.

In summary, the system addresses hunger by selecting the Court of Justice, picking up food, consuming it, and then retrieving the guest. The process is connected to various events and outgoing connections, ultimately leading to the completion of the cooking process.
