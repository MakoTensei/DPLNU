 In the world of credit scoring, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process and respond to scoring requests. Here's a natural flow of events:

1. A scoring request is obtained, triggering the following actions:
   - Task 1 (sid-FC703726-A395-41AE-9277-05E5C2F37566) forwards the request to the lending front.
   - Task 2 (sid-3F857AFB-3BA2-4514-9012-66D0344ABCC8) reports the results to the bank at Level 1.

2. The lending front receives the request and performs the first scoring (level 1), resulting in a pending result.

3. The bank receives the Level 1 result and decides to report the delay to the bank (sid-E736170E-C51D-4439-8628-DAD8F52723E5).

4. Meanwhile, the lending front performs the second scoring (level 2) and obtains the results.

5. The bank receives the Level 2 results and reports them to the bank (sid-6F7D3E28-D264-4AC9-BB83-05F2A465A7EB).

6. The lending front forwards the Level 2 results to the credit front (sid-A54752B2-6D47-48BA-8F22-8E82DC0934A1).

7. The credit front receives the Level 2 results and completes the scoring request (sid-230AC6D0-87CD-466F-A73F-2B7C62405394).

8. The bank receives the completed scoring request and updates the results (sid-178413ED-13D5-46E3-9480-219A48F633E5).
