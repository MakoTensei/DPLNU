 The process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' start event, which triggers the 'Request a quote' task. This task requires the 'Type of shipping?' input, which is provided by the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. The 'Request a quote' task then leads to the 'Select offers' task, which in turn requires the 'Type of shipping?' input from the same gateway. The 'Select offers' task connects to the 'Appoint forwarding' task, which also requires the 'Type of shipping?' input. The 'Appoint forwarding' task leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, which can handle multiple tasks such as 'Fill standard package voucher' and 'Complete insurance'. The 'Fill standard package voucher' task requires the 'Type of shipping?' input, while the 'Complete insurance' task requires the 'Insurance necessary?' input. Both of these inputs are provided by the respective gateways. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway4' task, which handles the 'EndEvent0' task. The 'EndEvent0' task requires the 'Type of shipping?' input, which is provided by the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. The 'ParallelGateway3' task, which handles the 'Request a quote' task, also connects to the 'ParallelGateway4' task. The 'ParallelGateway3' task requires the 'Goods for shipping' input, which is provided by the start event. The 'ParallelGateway4' task handles the 'EndEvent0' task, which is the final event in the process.
