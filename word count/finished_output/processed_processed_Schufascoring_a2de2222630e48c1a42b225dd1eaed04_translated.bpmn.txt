 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nrequired' event, which triggers the 'Result Level 2 forward' task. This task is responsible for transmitting the 'Results Level 2\nsubmitted' data to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Next, the 'Scoring request\nReport' event initiates the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task, which in turn reports the 'Results Level 1\nsubmitted' data.

Following this, the 'Result Level 1\nsubmitted' data is transmitted to the 'EventBasedGateway2', which then triggers the 'Result Level 1\ntransmitted' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Schufascoring\nrequired' event also triggers the 'Report delay' task, which reports the 'Delay\nReport' data.

The 'Delay\nReport' data is then transmitted to the 'Result Level 2\nsubmitted' task, which sends the 'Results Level 2\ntransmitted' data to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task receives the 'Results Level 2\ntransmitted' data and triggers the 'Result (level 2) report' task.

The 'Result (level 2) report' task reports the 'Reported' data, which is then transmitted to the 'Result is fixed?' task.

The 'Result is fixed?' task triggers the 'Determining scoring results' task, which in turn reports the 'Result (level 2) report' data.

Finally, the 'Result (level 2) report' data is transmitted to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', completing the process.
