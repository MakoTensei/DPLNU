 In the process of scoring a request, the system initiates with a 'Scoring requested' event, which triggers the 'Request scoring' task. This task is responsible for gathering the necessary data and performing the initial scoring. Once the scoring is complete, the 'Answer' task is triggered, providing the results to the 'Share the result' gateway.

Simultaneously, the 'Result there?' gateway is activated, which checks if the results are available. If the results are present, the 'Level 2 scoring' task is initiated to perform a more detailed scoring. Upon completion, the 'Share result' gateway is triggered to disseminate the results.

In case the results are not available, the 'Announce delay' task is triggered, which informs the user about the delay and initiates the 'Level 2 scoring' task once again.

If the results are found, the 'Request edited' gateway is triggered, which updates the request status and concludes the process with the 'Request finished' event.

Overall, the system ensures a seamless flow of tasks and gateways to efficiently handle the scoring process and communicate the results to the user.
