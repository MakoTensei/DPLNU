 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to route the request to the 'Scoring message arrived' event. This event then sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn determines the scoring through the 'Determining scoring' event. Once the scoring is determined, the 'EndEvent1' is triggered, and the 'Scoring message arrived' event sends a reply to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' event initiates the process by routing to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway determines if the scoring is up and sends a 'Report delay as a result' event to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then routes the 'Report delay as a result' event to the 'Delay display' event, which displays the delay information.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' event is triggered, signaling the completion of the scoring process. The 'Scoring message arrived' event sends a 'Delivering result' message to 'EndEvent0', and the 'EndEvent1' event concludes the process.
