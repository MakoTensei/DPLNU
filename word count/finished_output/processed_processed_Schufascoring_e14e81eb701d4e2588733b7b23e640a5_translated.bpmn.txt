 In the scoring process, a StartEvent0 initiates the workflow, which triggers an IntermediateCatchEvent3. This event is connected to an ExclusiveGateway1, where the decision is made whether the scoring result is available. If the result is available, the workflow proceeds to EndEvent0, passing through IntermediateCatchEvent2. However, if the scoring result cannot be determined, the workflow diverges to perform scoring, which can either result in Scoring lies before or Scoring cannot be determined. The latter leads to a different IntermediateCatchEvent4, which can either pass to Scoring lies before or to a task with the ID'sid-3F09F403-6D82-411E-B2F8-8BDF286B4571'. Meanwhile, if the scoring result is available, the workflow concludes with EndEvent0.
