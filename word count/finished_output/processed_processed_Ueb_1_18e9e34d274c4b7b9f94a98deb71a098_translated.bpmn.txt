 Upon receiving shipping costs, the process begins with checking the quantity of goods, which then leads to a request for three forwarders. The first selection of a forwarder triggers a specialist to be involved, who in turn checks insurance requirements. Once the insurance requirements are confirmed, the process moves to filling the package note, followed by a parallel gateway that connects to another gateway responsible for exclusive handling. The goods are then packaged and delivered, with the final step being the completion of shipping costs and the finished status of the goods.
