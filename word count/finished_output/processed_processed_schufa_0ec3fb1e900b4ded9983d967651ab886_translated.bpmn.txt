 In a workflow involving scoring requests, the process begins with a 'Request request' initiated by the 'Start Event' with ID'sid-9CE006E8-CA6D-41A0-9846-C2FB9BE65A9A'. This request is then shared with the 'ExclusiveGateway0' with ID'sid-1A43EB57-BB22-4733-8090-05C3F2C3BEED', which decides whether to delay the process or proceed.

If the request is not delayed, it proceeds to the 'Scoring request\nobtained' stage, initiated by the 'Scoring request\nobtained' 'Start Event' with ID'sid-29CC281D-70DF-43D7-8C44-1DD9551ED8E0'.
