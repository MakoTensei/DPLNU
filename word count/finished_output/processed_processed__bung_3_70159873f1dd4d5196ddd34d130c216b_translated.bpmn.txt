 When a regression is reported to VN, the process begins with the Regress authorized? gateway, which can either result in a payment or a closed status. If the regression is authorized, the payment gateway is triggered, leading to a payment process. Conversely, if the regression is not authorized, the ExclusiveGateway2 is activated, forwarding the issue to the collection process. Additionally, if the event is triggered after 10 days, the after 10 days gateway is activated, also forwarding the issue to the collection process.
