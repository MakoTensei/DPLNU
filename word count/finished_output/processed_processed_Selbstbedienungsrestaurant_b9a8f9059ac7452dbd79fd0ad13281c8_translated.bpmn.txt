 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and understandable way:

1. When a guest feels hungry, they can add their order to the system.
2. The guest's order is then processed, and they are directed to pick up their food.
3. Once the food is ready, the guest can pick it up and start eating.
4. After eating, the guest triggers the Pieper, who then hands out the meal to the guest.
5. The guest's order is now finished, and the meal is handed over to them.
