 In a financial services system, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process credit information and report results. The process begins with a 'Schufa request' initiated by the 'StartEvent0'. This request is sent to the 'Answer obtained' gateway, which then directs the process to the 'Credit award directing' task.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Report delay' task, which sends a delay notification to the 'Delay obtained' gateway. This gateway then sends the delay notification to the 'Level 1 scoring Execution' task, which awaits a 'Result found?' signal to proceed.

The 'Result found?' signal is received by the 'Result found?' gateway, which then directs the process to the 'Report the result' task for Level 1 scoring. This task sends a report back to the 'EndEvent1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Schufa request' also triggers the 'Exclusive Gateway0', which routes the process to the 'Delay obtained' gateway. This gateway sends the delay notification to the 'Report delay' task.

The 'Report delay' task sends a report back to the 'EndEvent0', completing the Level 1 scoring process.

The 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Level 1 scoring Execution' task, which awaits a 'Result found?' signal to proceed. Upon receiving the signal, the task directs the process to the 'Report the result' task for Level 2 scoring.

The 'Result found?' signal is received by the 'Result found?' gateway, which then directs the process to the 'EndEvent2'.

In summary, the system processes credit information requests, handles delays, and reports results through a series of tasks and gateways, ensuring efficient and accurate credit scoring.
