 When a customer initiates the process of sending goods, the system starts with the event 'Goods be sent' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway checks if special delivery is necessary and if insurance is required. If special delivery is needed, the process moves to 'Special delivery necessary?' which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway5'. If insurance is needed, the process goes to 'Insurance necessary?' which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

If neither special delivery nor insurance is necessary, the process proceeds to 'Filling the package note' which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway5'. After the package is filled, the goods are sent to 'Packaging goods' which connects to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

Finally, the goods are ready for collection, and the process concludes at 'Goods ready for collection' which connects back to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
