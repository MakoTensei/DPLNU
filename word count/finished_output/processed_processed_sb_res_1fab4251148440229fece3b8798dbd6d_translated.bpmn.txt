 Let's describe the process flow in a more natural and understandable way:

1. When a customer feels hungry, the system triggers the event 'Hunger felt' and sends a request to the 'Get Pieper' gateway.
2. The 'Get Pieper' gateway retrieves a pieper (a food server) and informs the customer that the pieper will be ready soon.
3. Meanwhile, the system receives an order to prepare a meal and sends a notification to the 'Outputting meal' gateway.
4. The 'Outputting meal' gateway informs the employees about the order and prepares the meal.
5. Once the meal is ready, the'meal ready' event is triggered, and the system sends a notification to the 'EventBasedGateway0'.
6. The 'EventBasedGateway0' gateway informs the pieper to serve the meal to the customer and also sends an 'End' event to the 'inform employees' gateway.
7. The 'inform employees' gateway notifies the employees that the meal is ready and ends the process.
8. After the meal is served, the customer's hunger is satisfied, and the 'Famine' event is triggered.
9. The 'Famine' event sends a notification to the 'Get Pieper' gateway, which then retrieves another pieper to serve the next customer.

This process ensures that the customer's hunger is addressed promptly, and the meal is prepared and served efficiently.
