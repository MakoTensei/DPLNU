The flow of the process can be described as follows:

1. The process starts with the event "Hunger felt" where the user expresses their hunger. This triggers the user to add their order.
2. The user selects a court and waits until the row is ready.
3. Once the row is ready, the user is on the row and the Pieper starts cooking the meal.
4. The "Order of next guest we are" event is triggered, which sends the order to the EventBasedGateway0.
5. EventBasedGateway0 processes the order and sends two outgoing events: "Guest ready served" and "5 min past".
6. The "Guest ready served" event indicates that the meal is ready for the guest, and the "5 min past" event informs the user that it's time to wait for 5 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, the "Order by employees we are" event is triggered, and the employees are informed about the order.
8. The employees prepare the meal and inform the user that the meal is ready.
9. The user is then served the meal, and the process ends with the event "Meal for Guest x finished Finished".
