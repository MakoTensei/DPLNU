 When a 'Regression possibility submitted' event occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to handle the incoming possibility. The process begins with a 'Send a message' task, which communicates the possibility to the relevant parties. This message is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then determines the next steps based on the incoming 'possibility available?' query.

If the 'possibility available?' query indicates that the possibility is available, the system proceeds to the 'WV set' task. This task checks the availability of the possibility and, upon confirmation, sends a 'Payment Report' to the 'Payment Report' task. The 'Payment Report' task then triggers the 'Book payment' task, which closes the case with a 'Case successful' outcome.

However, if the 'possibility available?' query indicates that the possibility is not available, the system routes the 'Send a message' task to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then decides to either forward the case or close it based on the incoming 'Proceedings' or 'Objection' events.

In the case of 'Proceedings', the system moves to the 'Proceedings' task, which forwards the case to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway can either close the case with a 'Case unsuccessful' outcome or forward it again.

If the 'Objection' event is received, the 'Send a message' task is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then closes the case with a 'Case unsuccessful' outcome.

In summary, the system handles a 'Regression possibility submitted' event by sending a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which determines the next steps based on the incoming 'possibility available?' query. The system then follows a series of tasks and gateways to either close the case successfully or unsuccessfully, or forward it for further processing.
