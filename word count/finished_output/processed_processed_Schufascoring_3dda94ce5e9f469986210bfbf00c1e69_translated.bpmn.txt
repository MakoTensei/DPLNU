 When a process begins with the StartEvent0, it triggers the IntermediateCatchEvent2, which is then followed by the Conduct Level 1-Scoring task, identified by sid-897A5009-8C0A-4CD4-97F3-723D105A8E40. This task, upon completion, leads to the EndEvent2. Concurrently, the StartEvent1 initiates the Result immediately available? task, identified by sid-1979DC28-B6B3-4AE6-8025-A3CE84825C99, which results in EndEvent2 and also sends a sid-70C249EA-7A8D-4564-B8BB-CB2B170E9EEB event.

Meanwhile, the StartEvent0 also triggers the Def. Result? gateway, identified by sid-6683D11B-FB1B-439D-8B87-327D6D3515F2, which in turn leads to EndEvent0 and EndEvent1. The IntermediateCatchEvent2, identified by sid-ACC4E427-5AFA-4BB8-8885-0F4543F0C949, is also triggered by StartEvent0.

The Conduct Level 2 scoring task, identified by sid-CA81E48D-A7EA-49FC-9C47-9FC4427A92BC, is initiated by the sid-247702CE-AA1A-45F6-B3E2-214388D6B3DA incoming event and concludes with the EndEvent3.
