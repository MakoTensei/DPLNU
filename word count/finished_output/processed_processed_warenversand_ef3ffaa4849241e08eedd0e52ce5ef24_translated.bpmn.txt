 The process begins at the 'Starting point' event, which triggers the 'Pick-up of offers (advertise shipping)' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Pick-up of offers (advertise shipping)' task.

The 'Pick-up of offers (advertise shipping)' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which leads to the 'Selection' task. The 'Selection' task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which subsequently leads to the 'Ordering Spediteur' task.

The 'Ordering Spediteur' task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which leads to the 'Insurance necessary' task. The 'Insurance necessary' task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which subsequently leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to the 'Providing the goods' task. The 'Providing the goods' task is linked to the 'ParallelGateway5', which finally leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts at the 'Starting point', moves through the 'Pick-up of offers (advertise shipping)', 'Selection', 'Ordering Spediteur', 'Insurance necessary', 'ExclusiveGateway3', 'ParallelGateway5', and 'Providing the goods', and ends at the 'EndEvent0'.
