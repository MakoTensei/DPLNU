 In the scoring process, a series of events and gateways work together to ensure the proper dispatch and shipping of scoring results.

Starting with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, it triggers the 'StartEvent1' which initiates the scoring process. This event has no incoming connections but sends a request to the 'Scoring\nresults?' gateway.

The 'Scoring\nresults?' gateway, identified by'sid-2C3C721B-3370-4B78-A990-2A908BE2AA52', receives the request and sends a 'Scoring (Level 1)\nsend' message to the 'Scoring\n(Level 1)\nperform' task. It also dispatches the event to 'EventBasedGateway1'.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' then sends a 'Scoring (Level 1)\ndispatched' message to the 'Scoring (Level 1)\ndispatched' task and sends a 'ParallelGateway3' message to the 'ParallelGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway3' gateways.

The 'ParallelGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway3' gateways both receive the 'EventBasedGateway1' event and send a 'Scoring (level 2) shipped' message to the 'Scoring (level 2) shipped' task.

The 'Scoring\n(Level 1)\nperform' task, identified by'sid-CCCF0841-767E-4101-93E8-25F30C465F2A', performs the scoring at level 1 and sends a 'Scoring (level 1)\nsend' message to the 'Scoring (level 1)\nsend' task.

The 'Scoring (level 1)\nsend' task sends a 'Scoring (level 1)\ndispatched' message to the 'Scoring (level 1)\ndispatched' task and sends a 'ParallelGateway3' message to the 'Parallel
