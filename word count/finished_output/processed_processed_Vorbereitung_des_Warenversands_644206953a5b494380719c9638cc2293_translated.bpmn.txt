 In a seamless workflow, the 'StartEvent0' initiates the process, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' where the 'Pick up offers' task (sid-F61BB626-BA2E-4665-81B0-24B7BF9CED9B) is triggered. This task then connects to the 'Specialist' (sid-72782B6B-47F1-41C7-A829-A685DA086CA3) for further examination. Concurrently, the 'Procurement examination' (sid-63E8FC73-4170-4227-9F4A-748A8D1755FE) is set in motion, receiving input from the 'Pick up offers' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Filling the package note' (sid-A8A2E3D8-8138-45F3-AED8-51654EDEA6E1) and 'Insurance' (sid-669CEB6D-6B49-4456-9430-647C6581A827) tasks are initiated, with the former receiving input from the 'Goods ready for collection' (sid-D88CD898-DA82-4B6D-BCFD-8A6F4DEE9916) and the latter being triggered by the 'StartEvent0'.

The 'Goods ready for collection' task then proceeds to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' (sid-688F5968-8019-4E84-97BF-D2D3DA9B6357), which in turn sends the task to the 'Packaging goods' (sid-BF3095D0-E49A-4F03-8CB0-77C2EAF64D9B).

Simultaneously, the 'ParallelGateway2' (
