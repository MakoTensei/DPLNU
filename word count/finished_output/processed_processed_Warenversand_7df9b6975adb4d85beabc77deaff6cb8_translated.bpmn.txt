 In the bustling world of logistics, a series of tasks and gateways work in harmony to ensure smooth operations. Let's dive into the intricate flow of these processes:

1. When a shipment is initiated, the 'Start\nShipment' event triggers the 'Insurance required?' gateway. If insurance is needed, the shipment is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If not, it proceeds to 'ParallelGateway6'.

2. 'ExclusiveGateway1' is responsible for handling small shipments. If the shipment qualifies as small, it is routed to 'ParallelGateway7'. Otherwise, it goes to 'EndEvent0'.

3. 'ParallelGateway6' is the gateway for shipments that require insurance. It sends the shipment to 'EndEvent0' if insurance is not needed, or to 'ExclusiveGateway1' if it is.

4. 'ParallelGateway7' handles small shipments. It sends them to 'EndEvent0' or 'ExclusiveGateway1' based on the insurance requirement.

5. The 'Secretariat' gateway manages the start of shipments. It sends the shipment to 'ExclusiveGateway1' if insurance is needed, or to 'ParallelGateway6' if not.

6. 'ParallelGateway6' sends shipments to 'ExclusiveGateway1' if insurance is required, or to 'ParallelGateway7' if not.

7. 'ParallelGateway5' is the gateway for 'normal\nPostal mail' shipments. It sends them to 'EndEvent0'.

8. 'Package tickets\nfilling' sends its shipments to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn sends them to 'EndEvent0'.

9. 'Select offers' is directed to 'EndEvent0' through 'ParallelGateway7'.

10. '1 freight forwarder', '2 freight forwarders', and '3 freight forwarders' all send their shipments to 'ParallelGateway6', which then routes them
