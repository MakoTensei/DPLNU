 In the process of handling a scoring request obtained from Schufa, the system initiates a sequence of tasks and interactions between various components. The journey begins with the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event, which triggers a 'Send delay' task to ensure the scoring process is not rushed. Concurrently, a 'Send scoring result' task is set up to handle the outcome of the Schufa request.

As the scoring process commences, the 'Level 1 Scoring' task is activated, receiving a Schufa request and directing it to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then forwards the request to the 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which awaits a 'Result\npresent?' message to proceed.

Upon receiving the 'Result\npresent?' message, the 'Level 2 Scoring' task sends a signal to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn triggers the 'Send scoring result' task to deliver the final outcome of the scoring process.

Simultaneously, the 'EventBasedGateway2' receives the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event and the 'Delay message\nobtained' event. It processes these events by sending a 'Scoring request\nFinished' message to the 'Scoring' task and a 'Scoring request\nFinished' message to the 'Delay message\nobtained' task.

Finally, the 'Scoring request\nFinished' event is triggered, marking the completion of the scoring process. The 'Delay message\nobtained' event also concludes, signaling the end of the delay mechanism.

Throughout this process, the system ensures a smooth flow of tasks and interactions between the different components, ultimately delivering the scoring results and managing the delay mechanism effectively.
