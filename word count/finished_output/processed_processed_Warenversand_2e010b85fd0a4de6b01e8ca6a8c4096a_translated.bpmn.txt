 The process begins with an 'Order to receive' event, which triggers a 'Shipping clarification' task to determine the shipping details. Following this, the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task is initiated, which takes in 'ParallelGateway4' and outputs 'Order Speditor'. This task is then followed by an 'Order Speditor' task that takes in 'Quantity' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, a 'Check insurance requirements' task is triggered, which takes in 'Quantity' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Order insurance' task is then initiated, taking in 'Insurance required?' and outputting 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is followed by a 'Delivering goods' task that takes in 'ParallelGateway5' and outputs 'Goods sent'. Finally, the 'Goods sent' event is triggered, which takes in 'Insurance required?' and ends the process.
