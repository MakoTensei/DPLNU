 The process begins with a Scoring request initiated by the 'Scoring request' event, which triggers the 'Process request, Scoring Level1' task. This task then sends an output to the'sid-09283AE1-1CE4-415C-BAD4-8CF9D5E6FF2C' gateway. The gateway, named 'ExclusiveGateway0', receives this output and sends it to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' then sends its output to the'sid-B2256194-A2DD-4054-BDAC-0D6858808622' gateway, which in turn sends its output to 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3'. Meanwhile, the 'Process request, Scoring Level1' task also sends its output to the'sid-6ABBE84C-4E44-43A5-92BF-2FBB64CF7BBE' gateway, which sends its output to 'EndEvent1'. The 'Scoring request' event also triggers the 'Process query, scoring level2' task, which sends its output to the 'Result' event. The 'Result' event then sends its output to 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3'. Finally, the 'Scoring request' event also triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, which sends its output to the 'EndEvent0' event.
