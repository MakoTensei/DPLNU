 The process begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'Clear delivery route' task. This task is facilitated by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which receives incoming traffic from 'ParallelGateway4'. Once the route is cleared, the 'Send a request' task is initiated, also through 'ExclusiveGateway0', receiving traffic from the same 'ParallelGateway4'. The request is then forwarded to 'Compare offers and choose the cheapest offer' via 'ExclusiveGateway1', which also receives traffic from 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The chosen offer is then forwarded to 'Appoint forwarding' through 'ExclusiveGateway1', which also receives traffic from 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Filling the package note' task follows, also through 'ExclusiveGateway1', receiving traffic from 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Next, the 'Securing transport insurance' task is initiated, which is facilitated by 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task receives incoming traffic from'sid-C63E4AD3-6975-4AC2-9ABF-1E81074257EA'. The insurance is then forwarded to 'Finish goods dispatch papers' via 'ExclusiveGateway2', which also receives traffic from 'Securing transport insurance'.

Finally, the 'Finish goods dispatch papers' task is completed, which triggers the 'Goods ready for collection' event. This event is facilitated by 'InclusiveGateway3', which receives incoming traffic from 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
