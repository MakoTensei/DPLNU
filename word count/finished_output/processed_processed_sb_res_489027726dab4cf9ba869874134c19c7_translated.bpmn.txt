 The task flow begins with the event "Feeling hungry," which triggers the Gateway "EventBasedGateway0." This gateway connects to the "Waiting up a row" task, indicating that the user is hungry and needs to wait in line.

Once the user is in line, they receive an "Info about order" event, which leads them to the "Place your order in Hochreich" task. This task is connected to the "Info about order" event, and it sends the user's order to the Hochreich system.

After placing the order, the user receives a "Wait for Piperton" event, which connects them to the "Piepton" task. The "Piepton" task is responsible for notifying the user when Piperton is ready, and it sends them to the "Pick up your order" task.

Upon picking up their order, the user experiences the "Eat meal" event, which triggers the "Cash" task. This task handles the payment process, and it sends the user's payment to the "Cash" task.

Finally, the "Famine" event occurs, indicating that the user has finished eating. This event is connected to the "Eat meal" task, and it signifies the end of the meal process.
