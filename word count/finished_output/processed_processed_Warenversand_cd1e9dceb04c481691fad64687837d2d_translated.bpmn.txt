 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task then leads to the 'Explanation' task, which in turn connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' then sends the 'large Lot?' query to the 'large Lot?' gateway, which directs the flow to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the 'large Lot?' query to the 'InclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'InclusiveGateway2' then sends the 'large Lot?' query to the 'InclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'InclusiveGateway3' sends the 'large Lot?' query to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Pick up offers' task also sends the 'large Lot?' query to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' receives the 'Filling the package note' event from 'InclusiveGateway2' and sends the 'Goods made available' event to the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways that ultimately lead to the 'Goods made available' event. The process involves tasks such as 'Explanation', 'Pick up offers', 'Select a quote', 'Specialist', 'Filling the package note', and 'Insurance close', as well as gateways like 'ParallelGateway4', 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'InclusiveGateway2', 'InclusiveGateway3', and 'ParallelGateway5'.
