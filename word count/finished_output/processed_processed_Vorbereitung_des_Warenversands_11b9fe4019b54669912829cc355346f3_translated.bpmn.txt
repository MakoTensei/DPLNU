 The process begins with the event 'Goods must be sent', which triggers the 'Filling the package note' task through the 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is followed by the 'Check product for size' task, which also uses 'ParallelGateway4' as its incoming gateway. Once the size is confirmed, the 'Pick up 3 quotes' task is initiated, utilizing 'ExclusiveGateway0' as its incoming gateway. This leads to the 'Selecting forwarding offers' task, which in turn triggers the 'Ordering the forwarding' task through 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Check product for size' task sends an incoming message to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then connects to 'Insurance type' task. The 'Insurance type' task sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which subsequently triggers the 'Complete insurance' task.

The 'Pick up 3 quotes' task also sends an incoming message to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which connects to the 'Selecting forwarding offers' task. The 'Selecting forwarding offers' task sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which then triggers the 'Ordering the forwarding' task.

The 'Ordering the forwarding' task sends its output to 'ParallelGateway5', which is the incoming gateway for the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Packaging goods' task sends its output to 'ParallelGateway5', which is the incoming gateway for the 'Prepare packaged goods' task.

Finally, the 'Prepare packaged goods' task sends its output to 'Insurance necessary?' task, which triggers the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event. This event has 'Insurance necessary?' as its incoming gateway and no outgoing gateways.

In summary, the process starts with 'Goods must be sent' and ends with 'Goods ready for dispatch', with various tasks and gateways working together to ensure the proper handling and delivery of the goods.
