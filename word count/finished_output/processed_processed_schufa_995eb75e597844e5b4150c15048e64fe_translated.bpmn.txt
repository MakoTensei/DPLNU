 In the scoring process, an event named "Schufascoring hit" initiates the process, which then triggers a "Scoring desired" event. This leads to the "Scoring Level 1 query" task, which upon completion, sends a result to the "Result?" gateway. The "Scoring Level 1 query" task then connects to the "Scoring Results Level 1 obtained" event, which in turn connects to the "ExclusiveGateway0".

Simultaneously, the "Scoring Level 1 query" task also connects to the "EventBasedGateway2" event. The "EventBasedGateway2" event then connects to the "Delay Report obtained" task, which sends a delay report to the "Delay Report obtained" gateway.

Meanwhile, the "Scoring Results Level 1 obtained" event connects to the "Scoring Results Level 2 obtained" task, which then connects to the "ExclusiveGateway0". The "Scoring Results Level 2 obtained" task also connects to the "Scoring Level 2" task, which sends the result to the "Result?" gateway.

Finally, the "Result?" gateway connects to the "Completed" event, which signifies the end of the scoring process.
