 In the process of scoring, a request for Schufascoring is initiated, which triggers a delay event. This delay event then leads to a reporting of the delay. Concurrently, another start event initiates the scoring process, which also results in a delay event. The delay event from the second start event is directed towards a level 1 scoring perform event. The level 1 scoring perform event, upon determining the results, triggers an exclusive gateway event that leads to the reporting of the scoring results. The reporting of the delay from the first start event and the reporting of the scoring results from the exclusive gateway event both conclude the process.
