 When a user initiates a scoring request through the "Schufascoring" inquiry, the system triggers a process that begins with the "StartEvent1" event. This event then leads to the "Scoring Level 1\nDebt" task, which determines the scoring for the debt level. Once the scoring is determined, the "Result\ndetermined?" gateway receives the outcome and forwards it to the "Scoring\ndetermined" task, which then sends the result to the "Result\nforward" gateway. This gateway then forwards the result to the appropriate recipient.

Similarly, if the user initiates a scoring request for "Scoring Level 2\nDebt," the process follows the same flow, starting with the "StartEvent1" event, leading to the "Scoring Level 2\nDebt" task, and ultimately determining the scoring. The result is then forwarded through the "Result\ndetermined?" gateway and the "Result\nforward" gateway to the recipient.

Additionally, the "Scoring\nReport" task can be triggered, which also leads to the "Result\nforward" gateway, where the scoring report is sent to the recipient.

In summary, the system handles scoring requests by initiating the process with the "StartEvent1" event, determining the scoring through the respective tasks, and forwarding the results to the appropriate recipients via the "Result\nforward" gateway.
