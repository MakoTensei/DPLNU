 To describe the flow of events in a more natural description, we can create a narrative that follows the sequence of tasks and interactions between the different entities (people, systems, and events) involved in the restaurant experience. Here's a natural flow description:

1. A customer feels hungry and decides to visit the restaurant.

10. The customer pays the invoice using their preferred payment method.
11. The restaurant staff cleans up the table and prepares for the next customer.
