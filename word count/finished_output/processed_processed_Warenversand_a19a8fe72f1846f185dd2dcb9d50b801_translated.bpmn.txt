 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped' which triggers the 'Pick up offers (special delivery)' task. This task requires incoming data from 'ParallelGateway4' and outputs 'Select 3 offers'. The 'Select 3 offers' task then requires incoming data from 'Lot?' and outputs 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' task, in turn, requires incoming data from 'Lot?' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Next, the 'Insurance close' task is triggered, which requires incoming data from 'Insurance necessary?' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task requires incoming data from 'Insurance necessary?' and 'Filled parcel note (normal mail)' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Clearing who is shipping' task is triggered, which requires incoming data from 'ParallelGateway4' and outputs 'Lot?'. The 'Lot?' task requires incoming data from 'ParallelGateway4' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Pick up offers (special delivery)' task then requires incoming data from 'ParallelGateway5' and outputs 'Goods provided for collection'. The 'Provide goods for collection' task requires incoming data from 'ParallelGateway5' and outputs no outgoing data.

Finally, the process ends with the 'Goods provided for collection' event, which requires incoming data from 'ParallelGateway5' and outputs no outgoing data.
