 In the scoring process, the 'StartEvent0' initiates the scoring by sending an incoming signal to 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which receives the 'perform first scoring' and 'final scoring' tasks. The 'perform first scoring' task is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which directs it to'sid-076C2573-B543-471E-9B78-E420A619B7BB'. Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway2' also receives the'second scoring: Define final scoring' task and sends it to'sid-A1BE8122-6CEE-4175-9D3A-74F33754818E'. The 'final scoring' task, which has no incoming connections, sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Scoring result\navailable?' event connects to both 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ParallelGateway2', ensuring that the scoring process is completed and the result is available. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0', which receives the output from 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ParallelGateway2'.
