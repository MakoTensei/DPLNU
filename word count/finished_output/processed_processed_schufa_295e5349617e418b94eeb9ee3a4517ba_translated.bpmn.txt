 When a request for Schufascoring is initiated, the system processes the request by forwarding it to the ExclusiveGateway1. This gateway then forwards the request to the Scoring process. Once the Scoring process is complete, the results are available, and the system checks if the results are ready. If the results are available, the system forwards the Scoring request to the Results are available? gateway. The Scoring request is then forwarded to the ExclusiveGateway1 again.

If the Scoring request is not ready, the system reports a delay and forwards the request to the Delay gateway. The Delay gateway then forwards the request back to the ExclusiveGateway1, which continues to forward the request to the Scoring process.

Once the Scoring process is complete, the system forwards the Scoring request to the ExclusiveGateway1, which then forwards the request to the Scoring forwarded gateway. The Scoring forwarded gateway then forwards the Scoring request to the Results are available? gateway.

If the results are available, the system forwards the Scoring request to the ExclusiveGateway1, which then forwards the request to the Scoring forwarded gateway. The Scoring forwarded gateway then forwards the Scoring request to the Scoring forwarded gateway.

If the results are not available, the system reports a delay and forwards the Scoring request to the Delay gateway. The Delay gateway then forwards the request back to the ExclusiveGateway1, which continues to forward the request to the Scoring process.

In summary, the system processes the Schufascoring request by forwarding it through various gateways and processes until the Scoring request is completed and the results are available. If the results are not ready, the system reports a delay and continues to forward the request until the results are available.
