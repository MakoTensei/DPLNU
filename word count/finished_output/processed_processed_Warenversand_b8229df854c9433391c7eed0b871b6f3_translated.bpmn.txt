 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs' start event, which triggers the 'Task1' task, involving the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then leads to '3 offers' and 'Filling the package note' tasks, which in turn require the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task is followed by 'Insurance required?' and 'Insurance close' tasks, which both lead to 'ParallelGateway3'. 'ParallelGateway3' then triggers 'Packaging goods' and finally 'provide for collection' tasks, which conclude the process with 'EndEvent1'. The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' events mark the end of the process.
