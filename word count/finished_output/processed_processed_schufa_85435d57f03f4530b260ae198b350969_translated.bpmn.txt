 In a system designed to handle scoring requests and delays, the following sequence of events and gateways work together to process and report information:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Share delay information' task. This task sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to initiate the process.

2. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the message and forwards it to the 'Determining scoring (level 1)' task, which is responsible for determining the initial scoring level.

3. The 'Determining scoring (level 1)' task sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to continue the process.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the message and forwards it to the 'Determining scoring (level 2)' task, which further refines the scoring information.

5. The 'Determining scoring (level 2)' task sends a message to the 'EndEvent1' to complete the scoring process.

6. Concurrently, the 'Share delay information' task sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to report any delay information.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the message and forwards it to the 'Delay reported' task.

8. The 'Delay reported' task sends a message to the 'EndEvent0' to conclude the delay reporting process.

9. The 'EndEvent0' receives the message and sends a response back to the 'EventBasedGateway3', which was initially triggered by the 'StartEvent0'.

10. The 'EventBasedGateway3' receives the response and sends a message to the 'Scoring reported' task to report the final scoring information.

11. The 'Scoring reported' task sends a message to the 'EndEvent0' to complete the scoring reporting process.

12. The 'EndEvent0' receives the message and sends a response back to the 'EventBasedGateway3', completing the entire process.
