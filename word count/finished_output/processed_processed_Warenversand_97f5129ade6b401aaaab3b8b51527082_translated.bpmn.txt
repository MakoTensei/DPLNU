 When goods are sent, the process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to handle the incoming goods. This gateway then connects to the 'Filling the postcard' task, which requires the quantity of goods to be filled. The task 'Filling the postcard' then communicates with the 'Quantity of goods?' gateway to obtain the necessary information.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods be sent' event also triggers the 'ParallelGateway3' to prepare the product for pickup. This gateway connects to the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which requires the goods to be ready for pickup. The task 'Provide goods for collection' then communicates with the 'Product Pickup ready' gateway to confirm the readiness of the goods.

Meanwhile, the 'Special offers Report' event, which is triggered by the 'Special offers' task, connects to the 'Special offers\nReport' gateway to obtain the report. This gateway then connects to the '(most convenient) select offer' task to select the most convenient offer based on the report.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway3' to handle the goods. The 'Filling the postcard' task obtains the quantity of goods from the 'Quantity of goods?' gateway, while the 'Provide goods for collection' task prepares the goods for pickup. The 'Special offers Report' event connects to the 'Special offers\nReport' gateway to select the most convenient offer. The process ends with the 'Product Pickup ready' event, which confirms the readiness of the goods for pickup.
