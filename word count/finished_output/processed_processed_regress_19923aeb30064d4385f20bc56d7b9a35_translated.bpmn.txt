 When the system receives an event indicating that "VN might take in Regress," it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to manage the situation. First, the task with ID'sid-918A27FA-6F60-4FFA-AB7D-A93992D4F0E0' named "Check the case" is initiated, which has an exclusive gateway 'ExclusiveGateway1' as its outgoing path. Concurrently, the task'sid-4E181B61-1D8D-4259-942D-1081772CFE33' named "VN payment request" is also activated, leading to the 'Set process for resubmission' task.

As the system processes these tasks, it also connects to the 'Regression possible?' gateway with ID'sid-747AAFD2-B7A3-4AEB-ABE9-C78AA1EC7534', which has two outgoing paths: 'Set process for resubmission' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' path is shared with the previously mentioned tasks, while 'Set process for resubmission' is linked to the task'sid-B9154AB0-6F75-4030-B378-39E2362A8FF9'.

If the system encounters an event indicating that "Proceedings" have taken place, it will route the event to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' with ID'sid-D7793517-21C9-4CDA-95C6-804CA5EF3B3E', which in turn connects to the 'Continue working on debt collection case' task.

In the case of a contradiction from VN, the event is directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' with ID'sid-D7793517-21C9-4CDA-95C6-804CA5EF3B3E', leading to the 'Case
