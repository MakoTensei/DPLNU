 The process begins with the 'Request request' event, which triggers the 'Create scoring request' task, generating a unique identifier'sid-713B5552-7F3F-459D-BD33-FE1F88E74EC5'. This task then initiates the 'Scoring L1' task, which receives the incoming 'Request request' and sends an outgoing 'Complete result?' to the 'Complete result?' gateway.

The 'Complete result?' gateway, identified by'sid-3F877CE3-179B-4EA4-B584-FB9C03834892', receives the 'Request request' and forwards the results to 'Results L1 reported' and'sid-C3218220-3C74-46FB-8A75-508598B59E81'. The'sid-C3218220-3C74-46FB-8A75-508598B59E81' task then sends the results to 'Result L1 forwarded' and reports a delay.

The 'Result L1 forwarded' task, identified by'sid-3BB783D6-AADA-4A4C-A6F6-964B207A9314', receives the 'EventBasedGateway1' event and forwards the results to 'Result L1 reported'. The 'Result L1 reported' gateway, identified by'sid-81652585-D51B-4041-A65F-F9ABDDD78591', receives the 'Result L1 reported' and sends the results to 'Results L1 reported'.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring L2' task, identified by'sid-sid-DC8F2033-5026-4A80-80DE-666051D19281', receives the 'Request request' and sends an outgoing 'Result L2 reported' to the 'Result
