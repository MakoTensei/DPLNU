 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check regression' task, sending a message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is followed by the 'VN' task, which is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Once 'VN' completes, it sends a message to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which in turn triggers the 'Payment is made - Book money' task. This task concludes with 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Examination' task, which sends a message to 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. Upon completion, 'Examination' leads to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Delivery time' task, triggered by 'StartEvent0', sends a message to 'Debt collection', which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Lastly, 'Check whether payment is made or received in opposition' task, triggered by 'Delivery time', also leads to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to 'EndEvent0'. The tasks and gateways are interconnected, ensuring a smooth flow of events and messages.
