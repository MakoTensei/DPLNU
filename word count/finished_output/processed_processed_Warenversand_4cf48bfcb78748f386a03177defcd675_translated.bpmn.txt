 In a bustling warehouse, the team is hard at work to ensure that goods are packaged efficiently and tickets are filled accurately. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating 'Offer 2', which is then directed to 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, 'Offer 2' transitions to 'Selection', which in turn sends its output to 'ParallelGateway5'. Meanwhile, 'Special delivery' arrives at 'ParallelGateway3', leading to 'Offer 3' and 'Offer 1' being processed. 'Offer 3' and 'Offer 1' both flow through 'ParallelGateway4' before reaching 'Selection'. Concurrently, 'Special delivery' also connects to 'Insurance?' at 'ParallelGateway3', ensuring that all tickets are properly insured.

As the tickets are filled, 'ParallelGateway5' receives inputs from both 'Selection' and 'ParallelGateway3', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'. This marks the completion of the ticket filling process. Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway5' also receives goods from 'Packaging goods', which are then dispatched to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Lastly, the 'Pickup' process kicks in, with 'ParallelGateway5' receiving goods from 'Packaging goods' and sending them to 'EndEvent0', signaling the successful completion of the pickup process.
