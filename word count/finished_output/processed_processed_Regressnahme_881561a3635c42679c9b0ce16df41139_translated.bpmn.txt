 In the financial services department, a series of tasks and gateways are interconnected to handle various processes. Here's a natural flow description of the tasks and their interactions:

1. A 'Suspicion Report' initiates the process, leading to an 'Examination' task. This task can either proceed to 'ParallelGateway4' or 'Possibility?' gateways.

2. If the 'Examination' task goes to 'ParallelGateway4', it can result in a 'Cash receipt\nCheck' task, which then connects to 'Book GE' task. Alternatively, it can lead to an 'Opposition Report' task, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task.

3. The 'Examination' task can also go to the 'Possibility?' gateway, which can either lead to an 'End the procedure' task or 'Open' task.

4. The 'ParallelGateway4' task can also lead to an 'End the process' task.

5. The 'Opposition Report' task can result in a 'Return OK' task, which then connects to the 'End the process' task.

6. The 'Date of expiry' task can lead to a 'Debt collection' task.

7. The 'EventBasedGateway3' task can lead to an 'End the procedure' task or 'Open' task.

8. The 'End the procedure' task can be triggered by the 'Possibility?' gateway or 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway.

9. The 'Open' task can be triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway.

10. The process can be initiated by a 'Suspicion Report' event and concluded by an 'End of procedure' event.
