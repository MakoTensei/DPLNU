 When a scoring request is initiated, the process begins with the 'Scoring requested' event, which triggers the 'Information about delay' gateway. This gateway informs the 'perform scoring level 1' task that a delay in scoring has been encountered. The 'perform scoring level 1' task then proceeds to process the scoring and sends the 'Schufa result lies ahead' event to the 'Result\nalready?' gateway.

The 'Result\nalready?' gateway receives the 'Schufa result lies ahead' event and sends it to the 'Schufa result lies ahead' end event, indicating that the result is now available. Meanwhile, the 'perform scoring level 1' task also sends the 'Schufa result lies ahead' event to the 'Schufa result lies ahead' end event.

Simultaneously, the 'perform scoring level 1' task sends the 'Scoring result sent' event to the 'Scoring result sent' end event, indicating that the result has been successfully sent.

In another scenario, when a 'Scoring request' event is triggered, it leads to the 'Result\nalready?' gateway, which sends the'sid-3D8D91F8-6AE0-424B-B9B2-6900CE0912E8' event to the 'perform scoring level 1' task, indicating that the result is already available. The 'perform scoring level 1' task then sends the 'Schufa result lies ahead' event to the 'Schufa result lies ahead' end event.

Additionally, the 'Result\nalready?' gateway sends the 'Scoring result sent' event to the 'Scoring result sent' end event, indicating that the result has been successfully sent.

Lastly, when a 'Scoring Level 2' task is initiated, it sends the'sid-788758E9-D4AC-45DA-BF91-DB45F08FE0E6' event to the 'Result\nalready?' gateway, which then sends the 'Scoring result sent' event to the 'Scoring result sent' end event, indicating that the result has been successfully sent.
