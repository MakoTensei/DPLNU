 Let's describe the workflow in a more natural flow:

1. When a 'Regression check requested' event occurs, it triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway.
2. If the 'Regress possible?' gateway determines that a regression is possible, it sends the process to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
3. 'ExclusiveGateway1' then checks if a regression has been completed. If so, it sends the process to 'Process with payment receipt completed'.
4. If the regression has not been completed, 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the process to 'ParallelGateway6'.
5. 'ParallelGateway6' sends the process to 'Money received'.
6. If the 'Regress possible?' gateway determines that a regression is not possible, it sends the process to 'justified?' gateway.
7. 'justified?' gateway sends the process to 'ExclusiveGateway3' if the event is justified, or to 'Process without payment completed' if it's not.
8. 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the process to 'Subject matter'.
9. If the 'Regression check requested' event also triggers 'EventBasedGateway4', it can lead to different outcomes:
    a. If the event is justified, 'EventBasedGateway4' sends the process to 'ExclusiveGateway3' or 'Process without payment completed'.
    b. If the event is not justified, 'EventBasedGateway4' sends the process to 'Close process without payment completed' or 'Outputting process to DL'.
10. If the 'Regression check requested' event also triggers 'Notification', it sends the process to 'Process without payment completed'.
11. If the 'Regression check requested' event also triggers 'Reimbursement period expired', it sends the process to 'Subject matter'.

This workflow ensures that the regression check is handled appropriately, with different outcomes based on the results of the check and the associated events.
