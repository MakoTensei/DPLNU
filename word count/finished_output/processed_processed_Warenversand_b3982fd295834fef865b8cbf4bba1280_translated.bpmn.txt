 When goods are sent, the process begins with a 'Clear delivery' task, which checks if a special delivery is necessary. If it is, the process flows to a 'Specialist' task, which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, the 'Clear delivery' task also connects to 'Pick up offers' task, which leads to 'Select your offer'. This task then connects to 'Specialist', and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

If a special delivery is not necessary, the process moves directly to 'Pick up offers', which connects to 'Select your offer'. This task then connects to 'Specialist', and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Once the goods are sent, the 'Pick up offers' task connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to 'Complete insurance'. This task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Complete insurance' task also connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to 'finished product for shipping'.

In summary, the process starts with 'Goods be sent', which can either lead to 'Clear delivery' and 'Pick up offers' or directly to 'Pick up offers'. The 'Clear delivery' task can either lead to 'Specialist' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' or directly to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Pick up offers' task connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which leads to 'Complete insurance' and 'finished product for shipping'.
