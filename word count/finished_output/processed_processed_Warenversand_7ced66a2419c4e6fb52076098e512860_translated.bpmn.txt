 When a special shipment is inquired about, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway connects to the 'Special shipment?' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'Find the cheapest offer' task. The 'Find the cheapest offer' task then connects to the 'Specialist' gateway. The 'Specialist' gateway connects back to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', and this process continues until the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway is reached.

The 'Insurance necessary?' gateway connects to the 'Check insurance' task, which then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' connects back to the 'Insurance necessary?' task, and this process continues until the 'ExclusiveGateway3' is reached.

Once the insurance is confirmed, the process moves to the 'Packaging goods' task, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' connects back to the 'Provide goods for collection' task, which concludes the process at the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with a special shipment inquiry, leading to a series of tasks and gateways that involve finding the cheapest offer, consulting a specialist, checking insurance, and packaging the goods for collection. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.
