 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring request' task, leading to an 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then directs the flow to the 'Follow-up' task, which can either be 'Follow-up' or 'Follow-up' depending on the incoming event. If the incoming event is 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', the flow goes to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and then to another 'Follow-up' task.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which connects to the 'Result\navailable?' task through 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Result\navailable?' task then leads to 'EndEvent1' upon completion.

Meanwhile, 'perform scoring level 2' task is triggered by'sid-C3A933BB-020D-4D6E-87C0-5EA99119E4C9' and connects to 'EndEvent1' through 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0' and 'StartEvent1', leading to different tasks and gateways, and eventually concluding with 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1'.
