 A customer experiences hunger and decides to order a meal. They enter their order and wait for it to be prepared. Once ready, they pick up their meal and enjoy it. After eating, they express their satisfaction and end the event.

Here's the flow of events:

1. The customer feels hungry and initiates the process by triggering the 'Hunger' start event.
2. The system responds by sending the customer to the 'Order' gateway, where they can place their order.
3. The customer places their order, which triggers the 'Order' start event.
4. The system retrieves the guest and sends them to the 'Retrieve guest' gateway.
5. The kitchen prepares the meal, which triggers the 'Preparation of meal' start event.
6. The meal is ready, and the system sends a notification to the customer, triggering the 'Ready for meal' start event.
7. The customer picks up their meal, which triggers the 'Pick up meal' start event.
8. The customer eats their meal, triggering the 'Eat meal' start event.
9. After eating, the customer ends the event, triggering the 'EndEvent2' end event.

This process ensures a smooth and efficient experience for the customer, from feeling hungry to enjoying their meal.
