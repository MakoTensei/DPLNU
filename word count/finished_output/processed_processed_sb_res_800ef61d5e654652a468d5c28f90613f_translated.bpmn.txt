 A guest arrives at the restaurant and is greeted by the ParallelGateway0, which then connects them to the ParallelGateway1. The guest chooses a court and waits for their order. Once the guest gives their order to the restaurant, the ParallelGateway1 processes the order and sends it to the Get a Piepers system, which provides information about the Pieper. The order is then paid for, and the cash is adjusted and transferred. The kitchen is triggered to prepare the meal, and the cook puts the food into the rich. The guest's order is successfully completed, and they leave the restaurant.
