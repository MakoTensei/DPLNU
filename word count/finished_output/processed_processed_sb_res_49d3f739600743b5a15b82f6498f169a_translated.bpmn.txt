 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph format:


When a guest experiences hunger, they trigger the process by selecting a restaurant. The guest then chooses a specific dish, in this case, a Pieper. The restaurant prepares the Pieper and hands it over to the guest.


Meanwhile, the guest places an order at the cash register, which is inputted into the system. The order is then processed, and the guest is directed to the court to finalize their order.


At the court, the guest receives the Pieper and takes over the service. The guest's interaction with the Pieper signals the next step in the process, which involves the Pieper breaking the beer order.


The guest then takes over the service, and the court proceeds to the Court of First Instance. The guest completes their order, and the process concludes with the guest finishing their meal.


Throughout this process, various intermediate events occur, such as the guest signaling the Pieper, the Pieper breaking the beer order, and the guest appearing at the court. These events are connected through gateways that facilitate the flow of the process.


The process starts with the guest's hunger, leading to the selection of a restaurant and the ordering of a Pieper. It ends with the guest finishing their meal, and the process is completed at the Court of First Instance.
