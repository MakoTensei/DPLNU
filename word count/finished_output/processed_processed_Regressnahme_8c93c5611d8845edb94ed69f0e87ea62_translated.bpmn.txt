 The workflow begins with the event 'Check regression' (sid-AD93C73A-3F4D-4DD3-9E9A-08C5F127501F) which triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway (sid-6443C56B-77AA-45D4-9512-721A9FEB3EF2). This gateway has two outcomes: 'Closed' (sid-51B5EFE4-63FF-4C70-BD00-82D0B9DEC370) and'sid-DE2C6D2F-85BA-4E69-9177-867E217C4E8E'. If the 'Regress possible?' outcome is 'Closed', the workflow proceeds to the 'Book payment' task (sid-D518CC7A-4A6B-4644-B111-C93056DB38AF) which is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway3' (sid-B2CEA949-D0F0-4AF0-8FFA-EAE2A1B98EC8). This task has two outcomes: 'Closed' (sid-51B5EFE4-63FF-4C70-BD00-82D0B9DEC370) and'sid-56E83FFD-9815-4562-B7BA-1FEDFBAD7147'.

Similarly, the 'Check payment receipt' task (sid-4EF4A8FA-B9DD-4C5B-B92A-85B2E06CF236) is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway3' (sid-B2CEA949-D0F0-4AF0-8FFA-EAE2A1B98EC8) and has two outcomes: 'Closed' (sid-0C677
