 The process begins with the 'My start' event, which triggers the 'Insurance necessary' task, ensuring that insurance is in place for the special shipment. This task then leads to the 'Special shipment necessary' event, which in turn initiates the 'Filling the package note' task to prepare the package for shipment. Concurrently, the 'Special shipment necessary' event also triggers the 'Ask Spediteur' task, which sends a request to the Spediteur for special shipment handling.

Simultaneously, the 'Insurance necessary' task also leads to the 'Complete insurance' task, which ensures that the insurance is finalized. This task then triggers the 'Ask Spediteur 1' and 'Request Spediteur 2' tasks, both of which send requests to the Spediteur for assistance with the special shipment.

The 'Ask Spediteur' task also leads to the 'Specialist' task, which involves a specialist in the process. This task then triggers the 'Request Spediteur 3' task, which sends another request to the Spediteur for additional assistance.

Once the Spediteur has been notified and the specialist has been involved, the 'Specialist' task leads to the 'Delivering goods' task, which is responsible for the actual delivery of the goods. This task then triggers the 'EndEvent0' task, marking the completion of the process.

Throughout this process, the 'ParallelGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway3' gateways play a crucial role in managing the flow of tasks and ensuring that the necessary actions are taken in parallel. The 'ParallelGateway2' gateway receives the 'Special shipment necessary' event and sends requests to the Spediteur, while the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway receives requests from the Spediteur and the specialist, and ultimately triggers the 'Delivering goods' task.

In summary, the process involves a series of interconnected tasks and gateways, starting with the 'My start' event and ending with the 'EndEvent0' task, with the Spediteur and specialist playing key roles in ensuring the successful delivery of the
