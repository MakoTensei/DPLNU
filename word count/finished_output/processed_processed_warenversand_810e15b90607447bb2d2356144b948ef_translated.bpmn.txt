 In a seamless workflow, the system initiates the process by determining the quantity of items through the 'Determine Quantity' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway4' and directs output to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Following this, the 'Large= 3 offers to get' task, also connected to 'ParallelGateway4', takes over to select the best three offers, sending its results to 'Select your offer'. Concurrently, the 'Small =\nFilling the package note' task, which is linked to 'ExclusiveGateway0', assesses whether insurance is necessary for the small package, and forwards the decision to 'Is insurance necessary?' task. This task, in turn, communicates with 'ParallelGateway5' to further process the insurance requirement. This integrated sequence ensures a smooth and efficient flow of tasks, maintaining a clear and logical progression from quantity determination to insurance assessment.
