 In the process of scoring and delivering results to a bank, the system initiates with the 'Scoring Required' event, which triggers the 'Delay?' gateway. This gateway determines if a delay is necessary and sends the 'Scoring Required' event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. Once the event reaches 'IntermediateCatchEvent5', it is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then sends the event to 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring Required' event also sends the 'Scoring Required' event to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway sends the event to 'Send result to the bank', which in turn sends the event to 'EndEvent1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request obtained' event triggers the 'Can the result\nsmart delivered?' gateway. This gateway receives the event and sends it to both 'Delay notification' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'Delay notification' event sends the event to'sid-8E3D1C49-AC86-420A-B0F4-307210468353', while 'EndEvent1' receives the event from 'Can the result\nsmart delivered?' and sends it to'sid-2847A104-AE98-40B1-B14A-35900B228C5E'.

In summary, the system starts with the 'Scoring Required' event, which triggers a series of events and gateways to determine if a delay is necessary and to send the scoring results to the bank. The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' events mark the completion of the scoring and result delivery process.
