 When you enter a restaurant, you select your order and wait. This process involves the 'Restaurant entering' gateway, which triggers the 'Select your order and wait' task. Once you've made your selection, the 'Add your order' task is initiated, allowing you to place your order. Following this, the 'Payment' task is activated, where you proceed to pay for your order. After payment, you can pick up your pieper, which is facilitated by the 'Pick up Pieper' task. The 'Accept order' task then records your order in the cash register system, leading to the 'Paying' task. Once payment is completed, the 'Pieper over' task is triggered, and the kitchen is informed about your order through the 'Koch inform' task. Finally, the 'Prepare food' task is initiated, and your order is prepared for pickup.
