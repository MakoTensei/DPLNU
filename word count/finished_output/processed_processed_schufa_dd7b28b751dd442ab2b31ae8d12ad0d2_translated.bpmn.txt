 In the process of determining partner data, the system initiates with the 'Start SchufaScoring' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then leads to a '15 min wait' period before proceeding to the 'Are there any results?' event. If results are available, they are passed to the 'Score performed' event, which in turn, can either go to 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'Feedback Result' based on the outcome.

Simultaneously, the 'Start SchufaScore for partners' event kicks off the 'Feedback Result' process. This event also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which can lead to two 'Score performed' events. The results from these events are then passed to the 'Score performed' event, which can either go to 'ExclusiveGateway2' or 'Feedback Result' based on the outcome.

In summary, the process involves multiple events and gateways, with the 'Start SchufaScoring' and 'Start SchufaScore for partners' events initiating the process. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' serve as decision points, leading to either 'Score performed' or 'Feedback Result' events, which then determine the final outcome.
