The 'New request' start event also initiates a 'Scoring?' start event, which sends a scoring request to the 'Scoring?' gateway. The 'Scoring?' gateway then sends a 'Follow-up' event to the 'New scoring' gateway and a 'Displaying' event to the 'Displaying' gateway.

The 'Scoring?' gateway also sends a 'EndEvent2' event to the 'Scoring?' end event.

The 'Scoring?' gateway sends a 'New scoring' start event, which sends a scoring request to the 'New scoring' gateway. The 'New scoring' gateway then sends a 'Follow-up' event to the 'New scoring' gateway and a 'Displaying' event to the 'Displaying' gateway.
