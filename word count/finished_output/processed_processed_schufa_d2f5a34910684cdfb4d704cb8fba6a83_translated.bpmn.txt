 The process begins with the 'Request request' event, which triggers the 'Get delay message' gateway to send a message back. This message is then used to initialize communication with the Schufasystem, as seen in the 'Initialized communication' event. Following this, the 'Start scoring request' event initiates the scoring process, which is handled by the 'Start scoring request' task. The task then sends a 'Scoring result sent' message to the 'Results obtained?' gateway, which in turn sends the scoring result to the appropriate recipient. Meanwhile, the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task is executed, sending a result to the 'Result sent' gateway. The 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' task follows, also sending its result to the 'Result sent' gateway. Finally, the 'Scoring result sent' event concludes the process by acknowledging the completion of the scoring task.
