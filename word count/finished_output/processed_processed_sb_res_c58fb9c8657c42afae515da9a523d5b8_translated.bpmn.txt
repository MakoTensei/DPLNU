 Let's describe the process flow in a more natural and understandable way:

1. The process starts when a guest expresses hunger, triggering the selection of a court.

2. The guest selects a court, which leads to adding their order.

3. The order is then picked up, and the guest is informed that their food will be ready in 5 minutes.

4. After 5 minutes, the food is ready, and the guest is prompted to eat.

5. Once the guest has finished eating, the process ends, and the employees are informed.
