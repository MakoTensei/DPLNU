 A shipment process begins with the 'Shipment' start event, which triggers the 'large\nLot?' gateway. This gateway initiates the 'Pick up offers' task, which is responsible for collecting offers related to the shipment. Simultaneously, the 'large\nLot?' gateway also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which handles the documentation required for the shipment.

Once the 'Pick up offers' task is completed, it sends an outgoing message to the 'Select your offer' gateway. This gateway then sends an outgoing message to the'sid-9106F21C-9764-41BF-BA8D-70A05987402F' task, which is responsible for selecting the appropriate offer for the shipment.
