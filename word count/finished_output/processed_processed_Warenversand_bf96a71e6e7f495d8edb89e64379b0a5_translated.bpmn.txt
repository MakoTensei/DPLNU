 The process begins with the event 'Goods for shipping', which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. The 'Pick up offers' task then leads to the 'Special offer' task, which in turn connects to the 'Select the Spediteur' task. The 'Select the Spediteur' task sends the 'Special offer' to the 'Specialist' task, which then prepares the goods for shipment.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods for shipping' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends the'ready for shipment' event to the 'InclusiveGateway2', which in turn sends the'ready for shipment' event to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' task, which is connected to the 'Complete insurance' task, also sends the'ready for shipment' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Special offer' task connects to the 'ParallelGateway3', which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Packaging goods' task then connects to the 'Delivering goods' task, which sends the'ready for shipment' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the'ready for shipment' event. The tasks and gateways involved in this process include 'Pick up offers', 'Special offer', 'Select the Spediteur', 'Filling the package note', 'Specialist', 'ParallelGateway3', 'Packaging goods', and 'Delivering goods'.
