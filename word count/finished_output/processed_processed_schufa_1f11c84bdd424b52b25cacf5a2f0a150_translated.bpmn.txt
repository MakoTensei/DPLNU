 The workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Request Scoring' process. This process is then passed to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' which in turn sends the request to the 'Scoring' process. The 'Scoring' process performs level 2 scoring and sends the results to'sid-979D65DF-0DDD-488B-8004-F0E538D1650F'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring level 1' process which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then sends the request to'sid-46C578C8-0F4E-4174-99E5-2AB850DCD092' and'sid-C09A6D5F-6B92-4B32-A69B-10B74249F7E9'. Meanwhile, 'Delay notification' is triggered by 'StartEvent0' and is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Get the scoring' process is also initiated by 'StartEvent0' and is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' mark the completion of the respective processes.
