 In the logistics process, we have several tasks and gateways that work together to ensure goods are shipped efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

1. The process begins when goods are ready for collection, with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event triggering the collection of Spediteur 1, 2, and 3.

2. Spediteur 1 and 2 are collected through ParallelGateway4, while Spediteur 3 is collected through ParallelGateway4 as well.

3. The collected Spediteurs are then directed to ExclusiveGateway0, which has incoming connections from ParallelGateway4. ExclusiveGateway0 sends the Spediteurs to ExclusiveGateway3 and ExclusiveGateway3.

4. ExclusiveGateway3, which has incoming connections from ExclusiveGateway0, sends the Spediteurs to ParallelGateway7.

5. The task of choosing the cheapest offer is initiated, with ExclusiveGateway7 receiving incoming connections from ParallelGateway7. The chosen offer is then passed to Ordering Spediteur through ExclusiveGateway3.

6. Ordering Spediteur, which has incoming connections from ExclusiveGateway7, sends the goods to ExclusiveGateway3.

7. ExclusiveGateway3, which has incoming connections from Ordering Spediteur, sends the goods to Goods shipped through ParallelGateway6.

8. Goods shipped, which has incoming connections from ParallelGateway6, marks the end of the process.

In summary, the workflow involves collecting Spediteurs, routing them through ExclusiveGateway0 and ExclusiveGateway3, choosing the cheapest offer, and finally shipping the goods.
