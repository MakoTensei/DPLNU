 The process begins with a 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event, which triggers the 'Send a request to Schufa' task. This task sends a request to Schufa and informs the 'Delay\ninformed' gateway. The 'Delay\ninformed' gateway then shares the delay information, leading to the 'Level 2\nscoring' task.

The 'Schufa request\nobtained' event initiates the 'Level 1\nscoring' task, which determines the Level 1 scoring. This task is connected to the 'Scoring\ndetermined?' gateway, which edits the Schufa request with the Level 1 edited information.

Simultaneously, the 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event also triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1' task, which determines the Level 2 scoring. This task is connected to the 'Send Schufascoring result' task, which sends the Schufascoring result with the Level 2 edited information.

The 'Schufa request\nobtained' event also triggers the 'Send Schufascoring result' task, which sends the Schufascoring result with the Level 1 edited information.

Finally, the 'Level 1\nscoring determined' and 'Level 2\nscoring determined' events mark the end of the process, with the 'Schufa request with\nLevel 1 edited' and 'Schufa request with\nLevel 2 edited' tasks being completed.
