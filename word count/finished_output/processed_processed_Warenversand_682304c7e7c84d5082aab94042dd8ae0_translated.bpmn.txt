 Upon receiving a shipment, the system initiates a series of tasks to ensure the goods are properly insured and dispatched. First, the system checks if the goods must be insured, which is received from ParallelGateway5. If insurance is required, the system routes the shipment to ExclusiveGateway2, where it is further processed to determine if the goods need to be insured.


Simultaneously, the system also processes the shipment through ParallelGateway4, which is responsible for filling out a standardized parcel certificate. This task is triggered by the incoming event of a shipment and leads to the creation of Offers received, which are then sent to ExclusiveGateway2.


Once the goods are confirmed to be insured, the system sends the shipment to ParallelGateway5, where it is prepared for dispatch. This task is triggered by the completion of the insurance process and the outgoing event of ExclusiveGateway3.


In summary, the shipment process involves checking for insurance, filling out parcel certificates, and preparing goods for dispatch, with the system routing tasks through various gateways to ensure a smooth and efficient process.
