 In the scoring process, the Sufa system initiates a scoring query, which is captured by the IntermediateCatchEvent4. This event triggers a message to be sent to Schufascore, which is then handled by the ExclusiveGateway2. The scoring process begins with the StartEvent1, which sends the scoring result to the Scoring result is available? event. If the scoring result is available, the system proceeds to send the scoring result to the Scoring-ergebinis event, which is also managed by the ExclusiveGateway2.

Once the scoring result is available, the system shares the delay information through the IntermediateCatchEvent6, which is directed to the ExclusiveGateway0. The scoring process is completed, and the scoring result is sent to the scoring process completed event.

In summary, the Sufa system initiates a scoring query, which triggers a series of events and gateways to ensure the scoring process is completed and the results are shared appropriately.
