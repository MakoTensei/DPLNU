 In the logistics process, goods are first packaged and sent through ParallelGateway5. Once packaged, the process moves to ExclusiveGateway1, where the insurance requirements are checked. If insurance is necessary, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway2, which then sends the goods to ParallelGateway4 for delivery. Concurrently, the goods are also being delivered directly through ExclusiveGateway3.

After the goods are delivered, the process concludes at the End Event, where the goods are marked as delivered and the insurance requirements are checked again.

The process begins with the StartEvent0, which triggers the packaging of goods and the subsequent steps. The process involves multiple gateways and events, ensuring that the goods are packaged, insured, and delivered efficiently.
