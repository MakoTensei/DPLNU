 The process begins with the 'Shipping information' event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and leads to the 'Insurance close' task. The 'Insurance close' task is linked to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn connects to the 'EndEvent0'.

Next, the 'Delivering goods' task is initiated, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'. This task leads to the 'Check the product' task, which is linked to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Check the product' task then connects to the 'ParallelGateway6', which finally leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, the 'Select your offer' task is triggered by the 'Shipping information' event and is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'. This task leads to the 'Specialist' task, which is linked to the 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Specialist' task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', completing the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Shipping information' event, leading to the 'Packaging goods' task, which connects to the 'Insurance close' task. The 'Delivering goods' task is initiated, leading to the 'Check the product' task, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Select your offer' task is also initiated, leading to the 'Specialist' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Both tasks ultimately connect to the 'EndEvent0', completing the process.
