 When the 'StartEvent0' initiates the process, it triggers the'receive regression' event, which in turn leads to the 'Send a payment request' task. This task is connected to the 'Possibility' gateway, which then directs the process towards either 'Set process for resubmission' or 'Close'. If the process is directed towards 'Set process for resubmission', it results in the'sid-15CB6B72-1795-4B37-BEFC-AD3262AC1925' task. On the other hand, if the process is directed towards 'Close', it leads to the 'Close' task.

Simultaneously, the'receive regression' event also triggers the 'donate to debtor service provider' task, which is connected to the 'Not justified' gateway. This gateway directs the process towards either 'Close' or 'donate to debtor service provider'.

In summary, the 'StartEvent0' initiates the process by receiving a regression, which then leads to the 'Send a payment request' task. This task is connected to the 'Possibility' gateway, which directs the process towards either 'Set process for resubmission' or 'Close'. Meanwhile, the'receive regression' event also triggers the 'donate to debtor service provider' task, which is connected to the 'Not justified' gateway, leading to either 'Close' or 'donate to debtor service provider'.
