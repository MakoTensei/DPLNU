 Upon reviewing the provided data, here's a more natural and understandable flow description:


1. When goods are ready for dispatch, they trigger the 'Is there a lot?' event, which can lead to multiple paths:

   - If there's a large quantity, the event routes to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ParallelGateway4', where the freight forwarders are informed and quotes are created for Spediteur 1 and Spediteur 2.

   - If insurance is necessary, the event also goes to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn connects to 'ParallelGateway7'.


2. 'ParallelGateway4' is a common gateway for both Spediteur 1 and Spediteur 2, and it also connects to 'ParallelGateway7' for informing the freight forwarders.


3. 'ParallelGateway5' is involved when goods are ready for pickup, and it connects to 'ParallelGateway6', which then leads to 'ParallelGateway7'.


4. 'ParallelGateway6' is a central hub for goods ready for pickup and dispatch, and it connects to 'EndEvent0' once all necessary processes are completed.


5. 'EndEvent0' signifies the completion of the process, and it receives input from 'ParallelGateway7', which is the final step in the workflow.


Starting Event:
- 'Goods ready for dispatch' initiates the process, leading to 'Goods ready for pickup' and subsequently 'EndEvent0'.


End Event:
- 'EndEvent0' marks the completion of the process, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway7'.
