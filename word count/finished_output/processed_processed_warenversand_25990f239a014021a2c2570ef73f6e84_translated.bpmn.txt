 In a logistics workflow, various tasks are assigned to different gateways to ensure efficient processing of goods. Here's a natural flow description of the tasks and their corresponding gateways:

1. When the need for a quote arises, the 'Pick up a quote for forwarders' task is initiated, which connects to 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is followed by 'Filling the package note', which is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

2. The 'Specialist' task, which requires expertise, is linked to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

3. To ensure the safety of the goods, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

4. The 'Packaging goods' task is initiated, which is routed to 'ParallelGateway7'.

5. To arrange for the collection of goods, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is executed, which connects to 'EndEvent0'.

6. The 'Books' task, which involves offering books, is connected to 'ParallelGateway5' and subsequently to 'ParallelGateway6'.

7. The 'Offer' task, which also requires a quote, is connected to 'ParallelGateway5' and then to 'EndEvent0'.

8. The 'Offer' task, which is again connected to 'ParallelGateway5', is routed to 'ParallelGateway6'.

Start Events:
- The 'Start 1' event initiates the workflow, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

End Events:
- The 'EndEvent0' event concludes the workflow, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Gateways:
- 'A lot?' event connects 'Start 1' to 'Filling the package note' and 'ParallelGateway6'.
- 'Insurance\nnecessary?' event connects 'Start 1' and 'ParallelGateway4' to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway
