 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the following sequence of tasks:

1. The 'Goods are to be shipped' event initiates the 'Check for special shipment' task, which is routed through 'ParallelGateway8'.

2. Concurrently, the 'Goods are to be shipped' event also triggers the 'Fill out standard package tickets' task, which is routed through 'ParallelGateway6'.

3. The 'Check for special shipment' task, upon completion, sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway4' for insurance processing.

4. The 'Fill out standard package tickets' task, upon completion, sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway7' for further processing.

5. The 'Pick up offers with three freight forwarders' task, initiated by 'ParallelGateway8', sends the goods to 'Select the Spediteur' through 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

6. The 'Select the Spediteur' task, upon completion, sends the goods to 'Spediteur 1 commission' through 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

7. The 'Spediteur 1 commission' task, upon completion, sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.

8. The 'Spediteur 2' task, initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway2', sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

9. The 'Spediteur 3' task, also initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway2', sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

10. The 'Complete insurance' task, initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway4', sends the goods to 'Goods ready for sale' through 'ParallelGateway9'.

This sequence of tasks ensures that the goods are shipped, insured, and ready for sale, with the involvement of multiple gateways and spediteurs.
