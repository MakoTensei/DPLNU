 When a news about a regress is received, the system initiates a process to check the procedure, which is justified if the regress claim is valid. Following this, the system proceeds with the process on WV, where it receives a notification of VN repeats and the date of expiry. The process on WV then sends the case to the debt collection service provider. Meanwhile, the system also books the entrance for the regress claim justified process, which completes the overall procedure.
