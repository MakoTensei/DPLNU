 In a scoring process, a task with the ID'sid-47C8EF83-B032-4220-9D13-A99954FFA444' initiates the process by triggering a 'StartEvent0', which then leads to an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. This event captures the incoming data and passes it to the'sid-BDDDE07A-FC6B-453F-9475-C4D38D89FCDB' gateway, which processes the 'Scoring result\nDebt' data and concludes the process with an 'EndEvent1'. Concurrently, another task with the ID'sid-403767EF-6A06-4C4A-92D8-CC0CB46D2D74' also starts with 'StartEvent1', leading to a 'Result is fixed?' gateway that sends the 'Scoring result\nDebt' data to 'EndEvent1'. The 'Result is fixed?' gateway also sends the data to the'send result' and'replication takes' events, which handle the finalization and replication of the results, respectively.
