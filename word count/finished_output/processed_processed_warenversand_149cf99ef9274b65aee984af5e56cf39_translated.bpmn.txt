 In the logistics process, a series of tasks are carried out to ensure the efficient movement of goods from retailers to end consumers. The process begins with the 'Order end consumers' task, which triggers the 'Pick up a quote from the forwarders' task. The forwarders then create an offer, which is sent to retailers through the 'Send offers to retailers' task. Once the retailers receive the offer, they proceed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' to complete the insurance process.

Parallel to this, the 'Order retailers' task sends retailers to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for insurance completion. The 'Spediteur creates offer' task sends offers to retailers, which are then received by 'Send offers to retailers'. The 'Offer of the freight forwarder' task is triggered by 'Send offers to retailers' and leads to 'EndEvent1'.

Parallel to the retailer process, 'Order end consumers' task sends consumers to 'Pick up a quote from the forwarders'. The forwarders then create an offer, which is sent to retailers through 'Send offers to retailers'. The 'Offer of the freight forwarder' task is triggered by 'Send offers to retailers' and leads to 'EndEvent1'.

Once the offers are received by retailers, they proceed to 'ParallelGateway3' to pack the goods and glue the parcel note. The 'Deliver goods for collection' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway3' and leads to 'EndEvent2'.

In summary, the logistics process involves tasks such as ordering consumers and retailers, picking up quotes from forwarders, creating and sending offers, completing insurance, packing goods, and delivering them for collection. These tasks are interconnected through various gateways, ensuring a smooth flow of goods from retailers to end consumers.
