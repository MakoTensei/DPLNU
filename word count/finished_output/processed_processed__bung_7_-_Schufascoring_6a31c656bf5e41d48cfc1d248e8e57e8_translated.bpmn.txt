 In the world of scoring and data processing, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure accurate and timely results. Let's dive into the flow of this system:

1. The process begins with the 'Schufa-Auskunft\nRequired' event, which triggers a request for Schufa data. This request is sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then forwards the request to the 'Scoringer bite\nReport' gateway.

2. The 'Scoringer bite\nReport' gateway generates a report and sends it back to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

3. Meanwhile, the 'Schufascoring request\nReport' event is also received by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which forwards it to the 'Delay\nReport' gateway.

4. The 'Delay\nReport' gateway processes the delay message and sends the report back to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then sends the 'Schufa-Auskunft\nRequired' request to the 'Scoring\n(level 1)\nperform' gateway.

6. The 'Scoring\n(level 1)\nperform' gateway processes the request and sends the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the results and sends them to the 'Scoring request\nAnswer' gateway.

8. The 'Scoring request\nAnswer' gateway generates an answer to the initial request and sends it back to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

9. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the results to the 'Scoring result\nforward' gateway.

10. The 'Scoring result\nforward' gateway processes the results and sends the final report to the 'Scoring result\ncompleted' gateway.

11. The 'Scoring result\ncompleted' gateway completes the scoring process and sends the final report to the end user.

In summary, the system starts with a request for Schufa data, which triggers a series of events and
