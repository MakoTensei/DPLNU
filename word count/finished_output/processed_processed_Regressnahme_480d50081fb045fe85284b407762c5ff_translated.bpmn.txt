 Upon receiving the 'News -\nRegression Case' event, the system initiates a sequence of checks and processes. First, it evaluates the regression case by checking if it is justified, which leads to the 'Regression\njustified?' gateway. If the case is justified, the system proceeds to the 'Payment\non request' gateway to handle the payment related to the regression case. Concurrently, the system also checks for opposition to the regression case, which is directed to the 'Opposition\njustified?' gateway. If the opposition is justified, the system moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to further process the event.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then receives the 'Expect event' and 'Reasons\nCheck' events, leading to the 'Tax payable on:\nDebt collection office' event. This event is triggered after 14 days following the payment method, indicating the expiration of the reimbursement period.

Throughout this process, the system ensures that all incoming and outgoing events are appropriately routed to the correct gateways, ultimately leading to the 'Process\nclose\n' event, which signifies the completion of the sequence.
