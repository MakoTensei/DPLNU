 In the shipping process, the journey begins with the 'Goods stand for shipping' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the incoming goods. From there, the goods can take different paths depending on the shipping mode.

For instance, if the shipping mode is determined to be 'Spediteur 1', the goods will pass through 'ExclusiveGateway1' and then proceed to 'ParallelGateway5'. This path is also shared by 'Spediteur 2' and 'Spediteur 3', which all have their incoming goods from 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Alternatively, if the shipping mode is 'Postal mail', the goods will go through 'ParallelGateway4' and then 'Filling the package note' before reaching the 'Pickup' event.

Another shipping mode is 'forwarding', which sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and then to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Lastly, if the shipping mode is 'Insurance close', the goods will go through 'ExclusiveGateway3' and then to 'ParallelGateway5' before being picked up.

In all cases, the 'Pickup' event marks the end of the shipping process, where the goods are collected from the respective gateways.
