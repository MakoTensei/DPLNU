 Upon receiving a regression, the system initiates a sequence of events to address the issue:

1. The 'Regression required' event is triggered, which sends a notification to the 'Regression required' gateway. This gateway then directs the process to either 'EndEvent0' or 'EndEvent1', depending on the specifics of the regression.

2. If the regression is deemed to require further investigation, the process continues to 'EndEvent0'. This event signifies the end of the initial regression process.

3. If the regression is not considered critical, the process moves to 'EndEvent1'. This event marks the conclusion of the less critical regression process.

4. In the case of an objection, the 'Objection' event is triggered, which sends a notification to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway then directs the process to 'Close', indicating the end of the objection process.

5. If the objection is not justified, the process continues to 'EndEvent2'. This event signifies the end of the objection process.

6. If the objection is deemed justified, the process moves to 'EndEvent3'. This event marks the conclusion of the justified objection process.

7. If the default period has expired, the 'Default period expired' event is triggered, which sends a notification to the 'Default period expired' gateway. This gateway then directs the process to 'EndEvent4', indicating the end of the default period expiration process.

8. If the default period has not expired, the process continues to 'EndEvent4'. This event signifies the end of the default period expiration process.

9. In the case of an incoming payment, the 'Incoming payment' event is triggered, which sends a notification to the 'Regression required' gateway. This gateway then directs the process to 'EndEvent1'.

10. If the incoming payment is not related to a regression, the process moves to 'EndEvent1'. This event marks the conclusion of the incoming payment process.

11. If the incoming payment is related to a regression, the process continues to 'EndEvent2'. This event signifies the end of the incoming payment process related to a regression.

12. If the incoming payment is
