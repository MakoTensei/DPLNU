 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs' start event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task takes in 'Shipping costs' and outputs 'Select your offer'. The 'Select your offer' task then takes in 'Type of shipping?' and outputs 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' task, in turn, takes in 'Type of shipping?' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway2'. 

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task has two incoming paths: one from 'Type of shipping?' and another from 'Filling the package note'. The 'Filling the package note' task takes in 'Type of shipping?' and outputs 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task then takes in 'Informing warehouse workers' and 'Insurance necessary?' and outputs 'Informing warehouse workers'. 

The 'Informing warehouse workers' task takes in 'ExclusiveGateway2' and outputs'sid-A6131852-757E-4E49-9F06-34082801D0D3'. 

The 'Pick up offers' task takes in 'Select your offer' and outputs 'Packaging goods'. The 'Packaging goods' task takes in 'ParallelGateway3' and outputs'sid-6629C8D6-8861-478A-9C2F-D25E98FD2F9C'. 

The 'Delivering goods' task takes in'sid-B64DF40E-E6E8-445A-9B20-369C517715BB' and outputs 'EndEvent0'. This marks the end of the process.
