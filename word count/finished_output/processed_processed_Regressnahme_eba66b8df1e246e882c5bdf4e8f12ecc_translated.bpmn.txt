 The process begins with a reported regression event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The first task, 'Check regression case', is initiated to investigate the reported regression. This task has incoming links from the 'Reported\nRegression' event and outgoing links to the 'Regression' event.

Next, a task named 'Payments send request to VN' is triggered, which has incoming links from the 'Reported\nRegression' event and outgoing links to the 'Reimbursement' event.

The 'Reimbursement' task is then initiated, which has incoming links from the 'Regression' event and outgoing links to the 'Opposition' event.

The 'Opposition' task is triggered, which has incoming links from the 'Reimbursement' event and outgoing links to the 'Close' event.

The 'Debt collection office' task is also initiated, which has incoming links from the 'EventBasedGateway3' event and outgoing links to the 'Close' event.

The 'Examination' task is triggered, which has incoming links from the 'Opposition' event and outgoing links to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' event.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is initiated, which has incoming links from the 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'Examination' events and outgoing links to the 'Close' event.

The 'Payment\nentry' task is triggered, which has incoming links from the 'Regression' event and outgoing links to the 'Close' event.

Finally, the 'Close' event is triggered, which has incoming links from the 'Regression', 'Opposition', 'Reimbursement', and 'Payment\nentry' events and no outgoing links. This marks the end of the process.
