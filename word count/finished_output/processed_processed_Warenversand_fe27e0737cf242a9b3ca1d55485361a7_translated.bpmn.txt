 When a customer places an order for goods, the process begins at the 'StartEvent0' gateway, which triggers the '3 offers' task. This task is handled by the 'Specialist' service, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Specialist' then sends the order details to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn forwards the information to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway is responsible for completing the insurance process for the order.

Simultaneously, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated at the 'ParallelGateway4', which is connected to the 'StartEvent0'. This task is handled by the 'ParallelGateway5', which sends the packaging details to the 'EndEvent0'.

Once the insurance is completed, the order is ready for collection. The 'Provide goods for collection' task is triggered at the 'ParallelGateway5', which sends the order details to the 'EndEvent0'. This marks the end of the process, and the order is ready for collection.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0' gateway, which triggers the '3 offers' task and the 'Packaging goods' task. The '3 offers' task is handled by the 'Specialist' service, which sends the order details to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' forwards the information to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which sends the details to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' for insurance completion. Meanwhile, the 'Packaging goods' task is handled by the 'ParallelGateway5', which sends the packaging details to the 'EndEvent0'. Once the insurance is completed, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is triggered at the 'ParallelGateway5', which sends the order details to the 'EndEvent0', marking the end of the process.
