 When a package is sent, the process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the 'Checking insurance needs' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' tasks. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Insurance necessary?' event is triggered, leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ParallelGateway5' tasks. Once the insurance is confirmed, the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task ensures the package is ready for dispatch. Concurrently, the 'Packaging goods' task at 'ParallelGateway5' prepares the package for dispatch. Finally, the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event signifies the completion of the process.
