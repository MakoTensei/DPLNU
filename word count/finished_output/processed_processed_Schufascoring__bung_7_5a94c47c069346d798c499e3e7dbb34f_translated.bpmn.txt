 In the world of scoring, a series of events and gateways work together to ensure that requests are processed and results are determined. Let's dive into the flow of this process:

1. When a 'Scoring requested' event occurs, it triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to handle the incoming request. This gateway is responsible for forwarding the request to the 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'Scoring requested' tasks.

2. The 'EventBasedGateway3' receives the 'Scoring requested' event and initiates the 'forward scoring results' task. It also sends a 'Result not fixed' task to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' if the scoring process encounters any issues.

3. If the 'Scoring requested' event is received by 'ExclusiveGateway1', it triggers the 'perform scoring' task and sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'Scoring requested' tasks.

5. The 'EventBasedGateway3' processes the 'Scoring requested' event and sends the 'forward scoring results' task to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. It also sends the 'Result fixed' task to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' if the scoring process is successful.

6. If the 'Scoring requested' event is received by 'ExclusiveGateway2', it triggers the 'forward result to Bank' task and sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

7. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then handles the 'perform scoring' task and sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

8. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'Scoring requested' tasks.

9. The 'EventBasedGateway3' processes the 'Scoring requested' event and sends the 'forward scoring results' task to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. It also sends the 'Result fixed' task to the 'Ex
