 When a goods shipment is requested, the process begins with the evaluation of the quantity needed, which is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway3'. This task is identified by the ID'sid-C8524C96-A5B7-4ADB-B2DD-EE33F8DF4873'. Following the evaluation, the system offers the customer a choice of Spediteur services, with 'Offer Spediteur 3' being one of the options, which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5'.


If the customer opts for 'Offer Spediteur 1', the system will use 'ParallelGateway4' to process the request and offer 'Offer Spediteur 2' as an alternative. Both spediteur services are connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which is the central hub for commissioning the selected spediteur and handling the 'big crowd' scenario.


For the 'big crowd' scenario, the system uses 'ParallelGateway5' to manage the situation, which also connects to 'ParallelGateway6' for further processing.


Once the goods are ready for shipment, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated through 'ParallelGateway3', which also connects to 'ParallelGateway6'. The 'Delivering goods' task is the final step in the process, which is triggered by 'EndEvent0' and is connected to 'ParallelGateway6'.


Throughout this process, the system ensures that the necessary steps are taken, such as evaluating the quantity, offering spediteur services, packaging the goods, and finally delivering the shipment. The 'ParallelGateway6' serves as a critical junction for various tasks, ensuring a smooth transition from one step to the next.
