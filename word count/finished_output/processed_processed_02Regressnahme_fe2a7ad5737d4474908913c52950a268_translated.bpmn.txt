 The process begins with the detection of a possible regression, which triggers the 'Possible regression\ndetected' event. This event leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway4' where the process is evaluated further. If the process is deemed justified, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway3' where it is determined whether the process should continue or return to the debt collection service provider. This decision is based on the 'Date of expiry' event. If the process is not justified, it goes back to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Set the process to "recovery"' task is initiated. The 'Set the process to "recovery"' task then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3' where the decision to return to the debt collection service provider is made based on the 'Date of expiry' event. If the process is justified, it proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway4' where the 'Check regression' task is executed. If the regression is confirmed, the process is closed. If the process is not justified, it goes back to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Set the process to "recovery"' task is initiated again. This cycle continues until the 'Close' event is triggered, which marks the end of the process.
