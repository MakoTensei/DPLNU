 When a 'Regression case' is triggered, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the situation. Firstly, it sends a 'Payment request to VN' to handle the case. Concurrently, it sets up a 'Process for resubmission' to manage any potential regressions. The 'Process for resubmission' is linked to 'VN', which in turn leads to the 'Process completed' event. Additionally, the 'Regression requirement possible' event connects to 'Representation Time' and 'ExclusiveGateway3', which also culminates in the 'Process completed' event. The 'EventBasedGateway5' is involved in the sequence, leading to the 'Close' event for the 'Regression case' and the 'donate to debt collection' task. This flow ensures a comprehensive approach to managing and resolving the regression case.
