 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Normal dispatch' task, responsible for shipping the goods. This task involves packing the product, which in turn requires commission from freight forwarders. Once the product is packed, the 'EndEvent0' is triggered, leading to the 'Special delivery' task. This task examines the normal shipment and determines if a special delivery is needed. If so, it proceeds to the '3 years enroll' task, which presents three offers to the customer. The customer selects one offer, which then triggers the 'EndEvent0' and leads to the 'freight forwarders commission' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Special delivery' task also checks if insurance is necessary. If it is, the 'Insurance' task is triggered, which presents two options to the customer: 'Insurance necessary?' and 'No insurance necessary.' The customer's choice leads to the 'InclusiveGateway4' task.

The 'InclusiveGateway4' task then directs the process to the 'EndEvent0' task, concluding the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0' and involves several tasks such as 'Normal dispatch,' 'Packing the product,' 'Special delivery,' '3 years enroll,' 'freight forwarders commission,' 'Insurance,' and 'InclusiveGateway4,' all leading to the 'EndEvent0.'
