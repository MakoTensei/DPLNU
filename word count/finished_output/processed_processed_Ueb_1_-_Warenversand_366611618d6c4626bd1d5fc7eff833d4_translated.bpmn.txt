 The process begins with obtaining shipping costs, which triggers the creation of three offers. These offers are then passed to ParallelGateway4. From there, the process flows to ExclusiveGateway3, where the quantity of goods is determined. Once the quantity is determined, the process moves to the Lot gate, which checks insurance requirements. The insurance requirements are then passed to ExclusiveGateway2, which completes the insurance process. After completing the insurance, the process proceeds to ExclusiveGateway3, where the goods are packaged. The packaged goods are then sent to ParallelGateway5, which prepares the shipment. Finally, the shipment is ready to be delivered.
