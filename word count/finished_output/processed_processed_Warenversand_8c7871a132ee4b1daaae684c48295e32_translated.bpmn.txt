 When a customer inquires about a large quantity, the process begins with the 'Clear shipping quantity' task, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to determine if insurance is necessary. If insurance is required, the process flows to the 'Insurance close' task, which then connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'. Concurrently, if insurance is not needed, the process moves directly to the 'Pick up offers' task, leading to the 'Select your offer' task and subsequently to the 'Specialist' task. Both paths converge at the 'ParallelGateway5', which then sends the customer's order to the 'Packaging goods' task. After packaging, the 'Delivering goods' task is initiated, concluding the process with the 'Shipping prepared' event.
