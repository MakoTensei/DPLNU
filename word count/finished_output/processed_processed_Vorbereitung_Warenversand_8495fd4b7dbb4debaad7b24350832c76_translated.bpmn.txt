 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the pickup of offers from the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The cheapest offer is then chosen, and a 'Specialist' is engaged to handle the offer. The 'Specialist' communicates with 'ExclusiveGateway3' to proceed with the next steps.

Next, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which requires checking insurance requirements. The 'Check insurance requirements' task is triggered, and it connects with 'ExclusiveGateway2' to obtain the necessary information.

Once the insurance requirements are confirmed, the 'Check quantity' task is executed to ensure the correct amount of goods is being shipped. This task connects with 'ExclusiveGateway3' to verify the quantity.

The 'Complete insurance' task follows, which involves finalizing the insurance details. This task connects with 'ExclusiveGateway2' to complete the insurance process.

The 'Packaging of goods' task is then carried out, which requires the 'ParallelGateway4' to provide the necessary packaging materials. The packaged goods are then sent to 'ParallelGateway5' for delivery.

Finally, the 'Providing the goods' task is executed, which involves delivering the goods to the customer. This task connects with 'ParallelGateway5' to ensure the goods are delivered successfully.

Throughout the process, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' serves as the primary gateway, connecting with 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' to facilitate the flow of tasks. 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5' also play crucial roles in the process, ensuring the goods are packaged and delivered to the customer.
