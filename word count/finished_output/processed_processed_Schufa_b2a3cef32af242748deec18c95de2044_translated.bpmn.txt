 In the lending process, the system begins with the task of checking credit awards, which is triggered by the event 'Sufa\nScoring\nthe'. This task is dependent on the successful completion of Level 1 scoring, which is signaled by the event 'Level 1\nScoring\ndelays'. Once the credit award is checked, the system proceeds to conduct lending, which is also dependent on the successful completion of Level 1 scoring.

If there are any delays in Level 1 scoring, the system will route the event to the ExclusiveGateway0, which will then determine the next course of action. If Level 1 scoring is successful, the system will perform Schufa Level 1 scoring, which is triggered by the event 'Scoring\nRequest\nobtained'. Upon successful completion of Schufa Level 1 scoring, the system will end the event with 'EndEvent1'.

If Level 1 scoring is not necessary, the system will route the event to the Level 2 Scoring Gateway, which will determine the next course of action. If Level 2 scoring is successful, the system will end the event with 'EndEvent2'.

In addition to these tasks, the system also performs other work, which is triggered by the event 'Level 1\nScoring\ndelays'. This task is dependent on the successful completion of Level 1 scoring.

Overall, the system follows a flow of events and tasks, with dependencies and gateways determining the next course of action based on the success or failure of previous tasks.
