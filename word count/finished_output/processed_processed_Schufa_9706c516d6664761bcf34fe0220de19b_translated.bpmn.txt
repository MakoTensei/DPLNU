 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring request' task, sending the request to the 'EventBasedGateway0'. This gateway then directs the request to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, initiated by 'StartEvent1'. Upon completion of the 'Level 1 Scoring', the task sends the results to 'Scoring\nResult', which in turn concludes the process with 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, the 'Level 2 Scoring' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', receives the results from 'Level 1 Scoring' and concludes with 'EndEvent2'. The 'Level 1 Scoring' task also sends its results to 'EndEvent3', completing the scoring process.
