 To describe the flow of events in a more natural language, let's create a narrative that follows the sequence of tasks and their interconnections based on the given data:

1. The customer feels hunger (Event: 'Hunger\nfelt').
2. The customer decides to visit a restaurant (Task: 'Visit the restaurant').
3. The customer selects a court (Task: 'Select a court').
4. The customer adds their order to the menu (Task: 'Add your order').
5. The kitchen prepares the food (Task: 'Preparation of meal').
6. The food is ready for serving (Task: 'Ready for meal\nPrepared').
7. The kitchen informs the employees about the prepared meal (Task: 'Inform employees').
8. The customer arrives at the restaurant (Event: 'Guest appears\nthe\nEnriched').
9. The restaurant serves the prepared meal to the customer (Task: 'Eat meal').
10. The customer's hunger is satisfied (Task: 'Hunger\ndistilled').

This narrative follows the sequence of events and tasks based on the given data. The events and tasks are connected through the Gateways, which determine the flow of the process. For example, the 'EventBasedGateway1' connects the 'Hunger\nfelt' event to the 'Select a court' task, and the 'ExclusiveGateway0' connects the 'Order\nNot applicable' event to the 'Add your order' task. The end events are 'Hunger\ndistilled' and 'Food\nIssued', which signify the completion of the customer's dining experience.
