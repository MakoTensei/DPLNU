 In a system designed to handle scoring events, there are several components that interact to process and conclude scoring activities. The process begins with a 'StartEvent0' that triggers the 'Send a message' task, identified by the ID'sid-3AED47C4-E8A6-43D5-B032-4714D3DA5DD7'. This task is responsible for initiating the communication process by sending a message to the'scoring yes no' gateway, which has the ID'sid-44456A38-726E-438F-9404-477C8A5CADF2'.

Upon receiving the message, the'scoring yes no' gateway, identified by'sid-44456A38-726E-438F-9404-477C8A5CADF2', processes the incoming message and generates an output that leads to two possible outcomes:'scoring?', which is handled by the 'Scoring Level1' task with the ID'sid-12FA7138-8F95-4C4A-A379-F724E0F768CB', and 'EndEvent0', which is directed to the 'EndEvent0' with the ID'sid-611AA389-FCE5-4348-9C67-D28439730A33'.

The 'Scoring Level1' task, identified by'sid-12FA7138-8F95-4C4A-A379-F724E0F768CB', receives the'scoring?' message and sends it to the'scoring?' gateway, identified by'sid-12FA7138-8F95-4C00-9ED0-E6A9E46A5D62', which then leads to the 'Scoring Level2' task with the ID'sid-C3E7EE3E-9060-455E-9856-
