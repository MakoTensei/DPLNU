 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'Pick up scoring' task, which triggers the 'Scoring Report result' task. This task is initiated by the 'StartEvent1' and can be followed by the 'Report delay' task if there's a delay. The 'Report delay' task can lead to 'perform scoring level 2' task, which is dependent on the 'Scoring immediately successful?' task. If the scoring is successful, the process continues to 'Scoring result' task, which is also triggered by 'StartEvent1' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Scoring result' task then leads to the 'Scoring Report result' task. On the other hand, if there's a delay, the process ends with the 'EndEvent0' task.
