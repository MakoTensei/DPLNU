 In a system designed to manage various tasks and events, there are several key components that interact to ensure smooth operations. Let's explore the flow of tasks and events within this system, focusing on the specific tasks and their corresponding gateways.

The system begins with the 'Entrance Regress' event, which triggers the 'Check regression' task. This task is responsible for verifying the integrity of the system by checking for any regression issues. It receives incoming messages from the 'Entrance Regress' event and sends outgoing messages to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Send a message' task is initiated, which also receives incoming messages from the 'Entrance Regress' event and sends outgoing messages to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is responsible for sending messages to other components or systems as needed.

The 'Book payment receipt' task is triggered by the 'Incoming payment' event, which receives incoming messages from the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends outgoing messages to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is responsible for processing and recording incoming payments.

The 'Proceedings' task is initiated by the 'VN' event, which receives incoming messages from the 'EventBasedGateway4' and sends outgoing messages to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is responsible for handling proceedings related to the system.

The 'Tax payable by Debt collection office' task is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway4' event, which receives incoming messages from the 'EventBasedGateway4' and sends outgoing messages to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task is responsible for calculating and processing tax payments for debt collection offices.

The 'on resubmission\nset' task is initiated by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' event, which receives incoming messages from the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends outgoing messages to the 'Incoming payment'. This task is responsible for handling resubmissions and setting up the necessary conditions for the next steps.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway receives incoming messages from the 'Entrance Regress' event and sends outgoing
