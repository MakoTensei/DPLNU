 The process begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to initiate the 'fill in the package' task. This task is then passed to 'ParallelGateway2', which sends a message to 'A lot small?' and subsequently connects to '3 offers'. The '3 offers' task is completed and sends a message to 'ParallelGateway3'. Meanwhile, 'normal post dispatch' and 'packaging goods' tasks are also initiated, both of which send messages to 'ParallelGateway2' and then to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Complete insurance' task is also connected to 'ParallelGateway3'. Finally, the 'Goods for shipping' task is completed and sends a message to 'End'. The 'End' event is triggered when 'ParallelGateway3' receives a message, marking the completion of the process.
