 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. This gateway then directs the flow to the 'Pick up offers from forwarders' task, which in turn sends the 'Goods are to be shipped' message to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Type of shipping?' gateway also sends the 'Type of shipping?' message to the 'Specialist' task, which then routes the flow to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Specialist' task receives the 'Type of shipping?' message and sends it to the 'Clearing insurance requirements' task. This task then sends the 'Type of shipping?' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which routes the flow to the 'Insurance required?' task. The 'Insurance required?' task receives the 'Type of shipping?' message and sends the 'Insurance required?' message to the 'Packaging goods' task.

The 'Packaging goods' task sends the 'Goods are to be shipped' message to the 'ParallelGateway4' and the 'Insurance required?' message to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the 'Insurance required?' message to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'EndEvent0' task receives the 'Insurance required?' message and completes the process.
