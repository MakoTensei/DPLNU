 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the packaging of goods. This leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, which then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway5' for delivery. Concurrently, 'ParallelGateway4' also sends the goods to 'Shipping way?' gateway, which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway directs the goods to 'EndEvent0' after determining the transit route.

Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway4' also sends the goods to 'Insurance required?' gateway, which connects to 'Complete insurance'. This task ensures that the insurance liability is checked and completed before the goods are shipped. The 'Complete insurance' task then connects to 'EndEvent0' as well.

After the goods are shipped, 'ParallelGateway7' sends the goods to 'Delivering goods' task, which then connects to 'EndEvent0'. This marks the completion of the delivery process.

In summary, the process involves packaging the goods, determining the transit route, checking insurance liability, and delivering the goods, all leading to the 'EndEvent0' event.
