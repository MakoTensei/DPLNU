 The workflow begins with the 'Shipment' start event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to handle the shipment. This gateway then routes the shipment to the 'ParallelGateway3', which is responsible for picking up offers.

The 'ParallelGateway3' has incoming connections from 'Pick up offers' and 'Offer A', and it sends outgoing connections to 'EndEvent0' and 'ParallelGateway4'. 'EndEvent0' is the endpoint for 'Offer A' and 'Offer B', while 'ParallelGateway4' is the endpoint for 'Offer C'.

Meanwhile, 'Offer A', 'Offer B', and 'Offer C' are all connected to 'ParallelGateway4', which then routes to 'EndEvent0'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' is responsible for handling insurance and packaging goods. It receives incoming connections from 'ParallelGateway5' and 'Shipment', and sends outgoing connections to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ParallelGateway6'.

The 'ParallelGateway6' is the endpoint for all the outgoing connections from 'ParallelGateway5', 'ParallelGateway3', and 'ParallelGateway4'. It also receives incoming connections from 'ParallelGateway5' and 'Shipment', and sends outgoing connections to 'EndEvent1'.

Finally, 'EndEvent1' is the endpoint for the 'Delivering goods' process, which receives incoming connections from 'ParallelGateway6' and sends outgoing connections to the end of the workflow.
