 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', which then leads to the 'Scoring\nStart' task. This task initiates the scoring level 1 process, which is triggered by 'StartEvent1'. The scoring level 1 process is then followed by the 'Delay?' gateway, which takes 1 minute before transitioning to 'EndEvent2'. After the delay, the 'perform scoring level 2' task is triggered by 'StartEvent1', leading to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway. This gateway then transitions to 'EndEvent1'. The scoring level 2 process is followed by the 'Delay?' gateway, which determines the outcome and transitions to 'Ergenis determined'. This triggers the 'EndEvent3' task, marking the end of the scoring process.
