 Let's start with the process of shipping goods. The first step is to set the shipping mode, which is done through the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway then triggers 'Task1', which is responsible for selecting the shipping service provider, in this case, 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Upon entering 'ExclusiveGateway0', the process continues with 'Request a quote', which is executed through 'ParallelGateway3'. This request is made to find the cheapest offer for the shipping service. Once the cheapest offer is selected, 'Choose the cheapest offer' is triggered, and the order is placed with 'Order Speditaire'.

The goods are then packaged by 'ParallelGateway4', and 'Complete insurance' is initiated through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The goods are insured and ready for shipping.

The shipping process continues through 'ParallelGateway5', which is the final gateway for the goods to be delivered. If no insurance is chosen, the process still ends with the goods being ready for collection.

In summary, the process of shipping goods involves setting the shipping mode, selecting the shipping service provider, requesting a quote, choosing the cheapest offer, packaging the goods, completing insurance, and finally delivering the goods.
