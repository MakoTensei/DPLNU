 When a regression possibility is identified, the process begins with the 'Regression VN possible' start event. This triggers the 'yes' incoming event, which then leads to the 'Close the case' task.

Upon closing the case, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' event, which is triggered by the 'yes' incoming event. This gateway determines whether the opposition is justified. If the opposition is justified, the process proceeds to 'Close the process' task. If not, the process moves to the 'Disclosure of debtors' task.

In the 'Disclosure of debtors' task, the '30 days' incoming event is triggered, leading to the 'EndEvent3' task.

If the opposition is not justified, the 'Disclosure of debtors' task triggers the 'EndEvent4' task.

In the 'EndEvent4' task, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' incoming event is triggered, which then leads to the 'EndEvent2' task.

In the 'EndEvent2' task, the 'EventBasedGateway2' incoming event is triggered, which then leads to the '30 days' task.

In the '30 days' task, the 'Send payment request and set process to reimburse' incoming event is triggered, leading to the 'EndEvent3' task.

In the 'EndEvent3' task, the '30 days' incoming event is triggered, leading to the 'EndEvent1' task.

In the 'EndEvent1' task, the 'Payment received' incoming event is triggered, leading to the 'EndEvent0' task.

In the 'EndEvent0' task, the 'yes' incoming event is triggered, leading to the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Regression VN possible' event, which leads to the 'Close the case' task. Depending on the outcome of the 'ExclusiveGateway1' event, the process either closes the case or proceeds to the 'Disclosure of debtors' task. The 'Disclosure of debtors' task can lead to either the 'EndEvent4' or 'EndEvent2' tasks, which then lead to
