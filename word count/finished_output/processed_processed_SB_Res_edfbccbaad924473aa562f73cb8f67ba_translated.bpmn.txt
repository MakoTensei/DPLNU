 Let's describe the sequence of events in a more natural flow:

1. The guest feels hungry, triggering the process to pick up a meal.
2. The guest places an order, which is received by the system.
3. The system selects a court to process the order.
4. The system sends a signal to the Piepers to prepare the meal.
5. The guest is informed about the order and the court they will be served at.
6. The meal is prepared and put into the reach for serving.
7. The guest arrives at the court, and the meal is served.
8. After the meal, the guest is informed about the completion of the meal and the end of the event.

Here's the flow of events with the given IDs:
