 The process begins with the 'Report\nRegression' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task with the ID'sid-3BC9F622-EFDA-4156-A818-E7CA7B755757'. This task is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which has incoming connections from 'Report\nRegression' and outgoing connections to 'on re-issue' and 'Reimbursement period expired'. The 'on re-issue' task, with ID'sid-8942A0B5-6B2B-4FEB-B934-3669B3B58E61', sends an 'Incoming payment' event to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn routes it to 'Incoming payment' task with ID'sid-1E6CC124-5384-4B62-8ABA-E3A310B9CB81', leading to the 'Close' event.

Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway0' also handles the 'Reimbursement period expired' event, which is incoming from 'Report\nRegression' and leads to the 'handed over to the collection company' task with ID'sid-325D0AFD-4688-4F0A-9F4D-C1636F7BCB35'. This task has no outgoing connections.

The 'Proceedings' event, with ID'sid-CBA785D8-94A5-45A9-9EAE-BDEF4E317B00', is received by 'ExclusiveGateway1' and results in the 'handed over to the collection company' task.

Finally, the 'Close' event, with ID'sid-E0142FAE-78CB-482C-B4B8-3FF0E90F2024', is the endpoint of the process, with incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway0', 'EventBasedGateway2',
