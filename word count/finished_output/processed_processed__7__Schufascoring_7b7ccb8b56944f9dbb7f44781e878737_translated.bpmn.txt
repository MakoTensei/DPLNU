 When a scoring request is initiated, it triggers the 'Scoring request' start event, which then sends the request to the 'Scoring Level 1OK?' gateway. This gateway, upon receiving the request, processes it and sends a 'Level 1 reported' message to the 'Determining scoring level 2' gateway. The 'Determining scoring level 2' gateway then determines the appropriate scoring level and sends a 'Level 2 reported' message to the 'Level 2' gateway. The 'Level 2' gateway then completes the scoring process and sends the final result to the 'EndEvent1' end event. Throughout this process, there may be instances of delay, but these are handled by the 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway, which sends a'received delay' message to the'received delay' gateway, and then proceeds to the 'EndEvent1' event.
