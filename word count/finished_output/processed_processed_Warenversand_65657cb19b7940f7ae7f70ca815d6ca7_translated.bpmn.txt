 Starting with an 'Order' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Order' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which routes the order to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
2. 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn sends it to 'ParallelGateway7'.
3. Concurrently, 'ExclusiveGateway0' also sends the order to 'ParallelGateway5'.
4. 'ParallelGateway5' sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which sends it to 'ParallelGateway7'.
5. 'ParallelGateway7' then sends the order to 'Goods ready for pickup'.

Simultaneously, the 'Order' event also triggers the 'Special offer' event, which sends the order to 'ParallelGateway4'.

1. 'ParallelGateway4' sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'Special offer'.
2. 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the order to 'ParallelGateway7'.
3. 'Special offer' sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the order to 'ParallelGateway7'.
6. 'ParallelGateway7' then sends the order to 'Goods ready for pickup'.

In summary, the 'Order' event leads to the 'Goods ready for pickup' event through a series of interactions between 'ParallelGateway5', 'ExclusiveGateway3', and 'ParallelGateway7'. Additionally, the 'Order' event also triggers a 'Special offer' event, which follows a similar path to the 'Goods ready for pickup' event.
