 In the workflow, the process begins with the event 'VN can potentially take the Regress' (sid-B70574E9-8C77-4CD5-A380-BF0C12F02991). This event triggers a check for the possibility of regression, which is received by the 'possibility available?' gateway (sid-12D3E96E-BF6E-49F1-9677-1ED6BD35E71F). If the possibility is available, the process moves to the 'Check regression' task (sid-sid-92242751-0B52-477F-BAF0-6BA417C085CE).

If the possibility is not available, the process moves to the 'Close' task (sid-sid-AC67A098-49BF-4A35-8C55-F101B00B3B7F).

In the 'Check regression' task, if the possibility is available, the process proceeds to the 'Set process for resubmission' task (sid-sid-ABA30FB1-EA9E-4B5B-98FC-52E6EE821710). This task triggers the 'possibility available?' gateway (sid-12D3E96E-BF6E-49F1-9677-1ED6BD35E71F) again. If the possibility is available, the process moves to the 'Send payment request' task (sid-sid-ABA30FB1-EA9E-4B5B-98FC-52E6EE821710).

If the possibility is not available, the process moves to the 'Close' task (sid-sid-AC67A098-49BF-4A35-8C55-F101B00B3B7F).

In the 'Set process for resubmission' task, if the possibility is available, the process moves to the '
