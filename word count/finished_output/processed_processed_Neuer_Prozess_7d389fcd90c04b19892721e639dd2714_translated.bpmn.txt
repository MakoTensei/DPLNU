 When a request is obtained, the system initiates the process by picking up the scoring list and informing the front. Once the scoring order is obtained, the system performs scoring level 1 and level 2, sending the results to the respective scoring result gateways. After obtaining the scoring result, the system checks if the scoring was successful and sends the scoring result along with the scoring order. Meanwhile, the front is kept informed throughout the process. Once the scoring results are sent, the system sends an end event, and the process concludes with the end event 0.
