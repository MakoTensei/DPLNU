 The process begins with the event 'VN can be Regression taken' (sid-841EE7D3-837D-4A15-9B3D-80327FD7F379), which triggers a check for potential regression. This leads to the 'Regress possible?' gateway (sid-96D86ADF-42E1-43DD-9A9C-9218671B8055), where the outcome is 'Closed'.

Following this, the 'Reimbursement process' (sid-16C4D6F7-6A12-44E4-B848-E16ED915A7E4) event occurs, which initiates the reimbursement process. This results in the 'Money obtained' (sid-1B4C3400-B7E1-4EB4-B4D1-DF4C97C00DD2) event, leading to the 'Close' (sid-266B32A3-DDAE-44C7-94F8-3C40393C2EAE) event, indicating the reimbursement process is closed.

Next, the 'VN contradicts' (sid-3803D31C-1735-417A-8E56-6C7CAB40DFD1) event takes place, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway2' (sid-846C25B4-7173-4F7E-9803-E81F871DA4E7) event. This results in the 'Closed' (sid-96D86ADF-42E1-43DD-9A9C-9218671B8055) event, indicating the EventBasedGateway2 is closed.

Lastly, the 'Date of expiry - best. Time to wait' (sid-79306669-3D76-4
