 In the process of shipping goods, the system initiates with the 'Goods Ship' event, which triggers the 'Lot?' event, leading to the 'Standard Fill in packaging paper' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' tasks. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then connects to the 'Insurance Necessary?' event, which in turn leads to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'Goods Made Available' tasks. Concurrently, the 'Lot?' event also connects to 'Provide Goods for Collection' task. The 'Goods Made Available' task is the final step, which is triggered by 'ParallelGateway4' and has no outgoing connections. This process ensures that goods are shipped, packaged, insured, and made available for collection in a seamless flow.
