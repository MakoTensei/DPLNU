 When a customer initiates a request for a quote due to a special shipment necessity, the system routes the request to the 'Specialist' for further assistance. The 'Specialist' then connects the customer to 'ParallelGateway5' to proceed with the process. Following this, the customer is prompted to fill in their insurance card, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Once the insurance card is processed, the customer is presented with the option to select their shipping mode, which leads them to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. After selecting the shipping mode, the customer's order is packaged by the 'Packaging goods' service, which connects to 'ParallelGateway5'. Finally, when the goods are ready for collection, the customer is directed to 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.
