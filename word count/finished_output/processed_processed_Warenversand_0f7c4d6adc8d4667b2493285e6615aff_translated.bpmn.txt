 In a logistics process, the following tasks are carried out in a specific sequence:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway is responsible for determining the volume of the goods to be shipped.

2. Once the volume is determined, the 'ParallelGateway3' is engaged. This gateway is responsible for filling the package note.

3. The 'ParallelGateway3' then sends a signal to the 'ParallelGateway4' to pick up the offer from 'Spediteur 2'.

4. Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway3' also sends a signal to the 'ParallelGateway4' to pick up the offer from 'Spediteur 1'.

5. The 'ParallelGateway4' then sends signals to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to choose the cheapest offer and to the 'Specialist' to handle the chosen offer.

6. The 'Specialist' then sends a signal to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to confirm the completion of the insurance process.

7. The 'ParallelGateway5' sends a signal to the 'Goods are ready to pick up?' to check if the goods are ready for pickup.

8. If the goods are ready, the 'Goods are ready to pick up?' sends a signal to the 'EndEvent0' to conclude the process.

This sequence ensures that the goods are packaged, insured, and ready for pickup in an efficient and organized manner.
