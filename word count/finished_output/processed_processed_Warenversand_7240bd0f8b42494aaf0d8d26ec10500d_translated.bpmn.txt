 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the packaging of goods using 'ParallelGateway4'. The packaged goods are then provided for collection through 'ParallelGateway5'. Meanwhile, the 'Special shipment necessary?' inquiry is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn connects to 'Clearing the shipping mode'. Once the goods are cleared, they are insured through 'Insurance close', which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The insured goods are then picked up from the pickup offers, which are determined by the 'Special shipment necessary?' inquiry. The process concludes with 'EndEvent0', which is triggered by the clearing of the shipping mode.
