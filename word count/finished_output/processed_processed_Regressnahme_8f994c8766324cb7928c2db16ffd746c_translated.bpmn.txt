 When a possible regression is detected, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, the 'Check regression case' task is triggered, which is directed exclusively to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task is designed to assess the severity and impact of the regression.

Simultaneously, the 'Send payment request' task is activated, which is also directed to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task is responsible for initiating a payment process related to the regression.

In parallel, the 'Reimbursement' task is initiated, which is directed to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task is responsible for processing reimbursements related to the regression.

The 'Close' task is also activated, which is directed to 'End'. This task is responsible for finalizing the process once the regression has been addressed.

The 'Book money receipt' task is also triggered, which is directed to 'End'. This task is responsible for recording the financial transactions related to the regression.

The 'Proceedings' task is initiated, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task is responsible for continuing the process after the initial assessment and payment request.

The 'Transfer to debt collection' task is also activated, which is directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task is responsible for transferring any debts related to the regression to a debt collection agency.

In summary, when a possible regression is detected, the system initiates a series of tasks to assess, address, and finalize the issue. These tasks are directed to various gateways and endpoints, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient resolution process.
