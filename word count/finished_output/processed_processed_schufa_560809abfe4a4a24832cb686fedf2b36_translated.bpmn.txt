 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring request' task with the ID'sid-CC5615C0-1F63-4299-A60F-F29ED6D0A53E'. This task then leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' with the ID'sid-C932FE9A-B68F-4C63-8840-3DB5C28DDD6E', which eventually results in the 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the '1. perform scoring' task with the ID'sid-01F04D6C-74A3-457D-948C-792DF5452278'. This task proceeds to the 'ParallelGateway2' with the ID'sid-3E6CB198-8B48-42A2-B18A-BDECB476AFD1', which then leads to the 'EndEvent2'.

The 'Result?' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', is connected to the 'ParallelGateway2' with the ID'sid-C7DFFA83-9233-43B4-9FA5-E6A79175F43C', and finally results in the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Final result?' task, initiated by 'StartEvent0', is linked to the 'EndEvent0' with the ID'sid-179F09DD-7585-45AF-89A8-94732A6FAB8A', completing the scoring process.
