 In the workflow, a scoring request with a report is initiated, triggering a send delay task to obtain the scoring information. Once the scoring information is obtained, it is sent to EventBasedGateway1, which then finishes the scoring request. Concurrently, an information request is processed, leading to Level 1 Scoring. Upon completion of Level 1 Scoring, the results are made available, prompting Level 2 Scoring. The Level 2 Scoring then provides the final information. The workflow also includes a delay task that is triggered when the scoring request with a report is initiated, ensuring that the scoring process is not rushed. The workflow concludes with the completion of the scoring request and the provision of final information.
