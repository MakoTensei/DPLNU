 In the process of handling a special shipment, the workflow begins with the initiation of 'StartEvent0', which triggers the request for a quote. This request is then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway0', where the selection and ordering of a forwarding company takes place. Once the forwarding company is chosen, the process moves to 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' also handles the task of filling the package note, which is then sent to the Laberbearbeiter. This task is completed at 'EndEvent1'.

Following the completion of the package note, the insurance close process is initiated at 'StartEvent1'. This process is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway1', which concludes at 'EndEvent2'.

Meanwhile, the forwarding company has prepared the goods for shipment, and the process of packaging the goods is initiated at 'StartEvent2'. The packaged goods are then made available at 'Package tickets available', which is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The forwarding company then sends the goods by mail, which is completed at 'EndEvent4'. Concurrently, 'ExclusiveGateway1' also handles the waiting for forwarders, concluding at 'EndEvent3'.

1. StartEvent0: Request a quote
2. ExclusiveGateway0: Select and order forwarding company
3. EndEvent0: Complete the quote request
