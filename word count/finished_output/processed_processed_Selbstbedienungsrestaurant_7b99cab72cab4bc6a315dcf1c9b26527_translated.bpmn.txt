 In a more natural and descriptive flow, the sequence of events in the restaurant management system could unfold as follows:

1. A guest feels hungry, triggering the event "Hunger felt" (sid-94D1778C-3868-4119-9269-A442D0017F92).

2. The system responds to the hunger by initiating the "Restaurant entering" process, allowing the guest to select a court (sid-id-sid-8369C556-2020-08-09-0000C0379886).

3. The guest chooses a court, which leads to the "Pieper triggered" event (sid-id-sid-8369C556-2020-08-09-0000C0379886).

4. The Pieper system, upon being triggered, sends an "Order placed" notification to the cashier (sid-id-sid-19201FC1-0A18-48E1-8E2D-A1861E2B1C7A).

5. The guest places an order, prompting the cashier to enter the order details into the cash register system (sid-id-sid-6A473A51-9E1B-472A-8E0B-B70021D7F9E5).

6. The cashier completes the order, resulting in the "Order finished" event (sid-id-sid-19201FC1-0A18-48E1-8E2D-A1861E2B1C7A).

7. The system then informs the kitchen to prepare the meal, initiating the "Meals available" event (sid-id-sid-551C246F-B8A2-4618-BFA4-5C620AEB44E6).
