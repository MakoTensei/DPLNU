 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs' event, which triggers the 'Clearing the shipping mode' task. This task is responsible for handling special shipping requests. Once the special shipping request is processed, the 'Select your offer' task comes into play, which then connects to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task is linked to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which in turn connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' task.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task is responsible for handling the 'Insurance necessary?' event, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is linked to the 'Packaging goods' task, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' task.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task also handles the 'ParallelGateway4' event, which connects to the 'Goods ready for pickup' task, marking the end of the process.
