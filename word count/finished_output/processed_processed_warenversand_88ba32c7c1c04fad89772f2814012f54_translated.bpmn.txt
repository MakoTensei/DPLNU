 When a shipment arrives, the process begins with checking the quantity of the items, which involves picking up offers from forwarders. This task is followed by selecting the best three offers from the forwarders and appointing forwarding to handle the shipment. For special offers, the shipment is filled in a package form for normal mail, and taxation is handled for commodity insurance. Packaging the goods is the next step, and finally, the packaged goods are provided for shipment.

The process starts with the 'Shipment' event, where the shipment arrives and triggers the 'Check quantity' task. This task picks up offers from forwarders, which are then selected and appoint forwarding. For special offers, the shipment is filled in a package form for normal mail, and taxation is handled for commodity insurance. The goods are then packaged and provided for shipment.

The process ends with the 'Shipment\nprepared' event, where the packaged goods are provided for shipment, and the ParallelGateway4 gateway handles the shipment.
