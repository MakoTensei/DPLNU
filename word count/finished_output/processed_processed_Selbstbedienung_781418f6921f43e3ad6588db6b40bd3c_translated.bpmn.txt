 The process begins with the 'Hunger' event, which triggers the 'Bring food' task. This task leads to the 'Waiting' state, where the user awaits their order. Once the order is placed, the 'Waiting' state transitions to the 'Add your order' task, which prompts the user to specify their order.

Upon receiving the order, the 'Add your order' task connects to the 'Pieper piepst' task, which represents the preparation of the food. The 'Pieper piepst' task then triggers the 'Deliver food' task, which is responsible for delivering the prepared food to the user.

Before the food is delivered, the 'Visit' task is triggered by the 'StartEvent1' event. This task leads to the 'Preparation of meal' task, where the cook prepares the meal. The 'Preparation of meal' task connects to the 'puts food in abundance' task, which represents the cook putting the prepared food in abundance.

The 'puts food in abundance' task triggers the 'Information to employees' task, which informs the employees about the food preparation. This task then transitions to the 'EndEvent1' state, marking the completion of the food preparation process.

Meanwhile, the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task, triggered by the 'StartEvent1' event, connects to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, which represents the food delivery process. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task leads to the 'Deliver food' task, which delivers the prepared food to the user.

The '5 minutes' task, triggered by the 'StartEvent1' event, connects to the 'EventBasedGateway0' task, which acts as a gateway for the food delivery process. The 'EventBasedGateway0' task connects to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, completing the food delivery process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Hunger' event, leading to the 'Bring food' task. The food is prepared by the cook, and the user places their order. The food is then delivered to the user, completing the process.
