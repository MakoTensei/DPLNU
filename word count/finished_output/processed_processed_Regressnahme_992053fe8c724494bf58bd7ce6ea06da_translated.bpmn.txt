 In the case management system, we start with the event 'Regression report\nwe are' which triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway. This gateway then directs the flow to 'ExclusiveGateway3', where the 'Opposition\nReport' is received, leading to the completion of the regression process and the final event 'Regression\ncompleted'.

Here's a more natural flow description:

1. The 'Regression report\nwe are' event initiates the process.
2. This event triggers the 'Regress possible?' gateway.
3. The 'Regress possible?' gateway directs the flow to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Opposition\nReport'.
5. Upon receiving the 'Opposition\nReport', 'ExclusiveGateway3' completes the regression process.
6. The process concludes with the event 'Regression\ncompleted'.
