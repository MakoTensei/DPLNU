 The process begins with the StartEvent0, which triggers the Start scoring process task. This task sends a request to the Send a request task. The Send a request task then sends the request to the Results Level 1 task.

The Results Level 1 task receives the request and sends the results to the Start Event 1 task. This task triggers the Scoring level 1 task, which determines the results and sends a message to the Start Level 2 task.

The Start Level 2 task receives the message and triggers the Transfer of results task. This task sends the results to the EndEvent2 task.

The EndEvent2 task, in turn, triggers the Results determined? task. This task sends a message to the Start Event 1 task, which then triggers the Transfer of results task again. This time, the Transfer of results task sends the results to the EndEvent3 task.

The EndEvent3 task completes the process.

In parallel, the StartEvent0 also triggers the Send Intermediate Info to Frontend task, which sends intermediate information to the Intermediate information task. The Intermediate information task sends the intermediate information to the Results Level 2 task.

The Results Level 2 task receives the intermediate information and triggers the Transfer of results task. This task sends the results to the EndEvent1 task.

The EndEvent1 task triggers the EventBasedGateway1 task, which sends a message to the Transfer of results task and the EndEvent3 task.

The Transfer of results task sends the results to the EndEvent2 task, and the EndEvent2 task triggers the Results determined? task. This task sends a message to the Start Event 1 task, which then triggers the Transfer of results task again. This time, the Transfer of results task sends the results to the EndEvent3 task.

The EndEvent3 task completes the process.

The EventBasedGateway1 task also sends a message to the EndEvent0 task, completing the process.

In summary, the process starts with the StartEvent0, which triggers a series of tasks that send requests, determine results, and transfer information to the frontend. The process is completed when the EndEvent3 task receives the final results.
