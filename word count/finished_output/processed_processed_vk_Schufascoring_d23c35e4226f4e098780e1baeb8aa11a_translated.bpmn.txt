 Upon receiving a Schufa request, the system first checks for the consent of the person to be examined. If consent is present, it proceeds to create a scoring request. The scoring request is then processed through a gateway that checks if scoring is required. If scoring is needed, the system performs level 1 scoring and sends back the result. Subsequently, level 2 scoring is conducted, and the final scoring result is reported back. Throughout this process, the system also handles error messages and delays as necessary.
