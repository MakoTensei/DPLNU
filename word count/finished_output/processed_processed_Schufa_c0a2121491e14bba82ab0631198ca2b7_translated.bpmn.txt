 The system starts with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Start system' gateway, which then initiates the 'Get Scoring' process. This process is triggered by the 'Scoring request' start event and sends a 'Message from SCHUFA' to the 'Message from SCHUFA' gateway. Once the scoring is complete, the 'View result' gateway is activated, prompting the user with the message "Please wait". The system then proceeds to the 'Level 1 - query' gateway, which receives the 'Scoring request' and sends an 'EndEvent1' signal. This leads to the 'Level 2 - Question' gateway, which is triggered by the 'Level 1 - query' gateway and also sends an 'EndEvent1' signal. Finally, the 'Finished result?' gateway is activated, prompting the user with the question and sending a 'Message from SCHUFA' and 'EndEvent0' signals.
