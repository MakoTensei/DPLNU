 When a customer enters a restaurant and expresses hunger, they are greeted by the receptionist who prompts them to enter the restaurant and select their preferred court. Once they have chosen their court, they are directed to the "1. in the snake" gateway, which leads them to the process of adding their order. After placing their order, they proceed to the "Pay order and receive Pieper" gateway, where they pay for their food and receive a Pieper pie. The customer then picks up their food and heads to the dining area to enjoy their meal. Once they have finished eating, they end the event by interacting with the "EndEvent0" gateway.

During this process, the customer is informed by the Koch inform gateway that their order is being processed. The customer is also notified that they need to pay for their order in cash, which is handled by the "Enter your order in cash" gateway. After paying, the customer receives a Pieper pie, which is communicated through the "cashing and Pieper over" gateway.

In summary, the customer's journey begins with expressing hunger, followed by entering the restaurant, selecting their court, adding their order, paying in cash, receiving their pie, picking up their food, and finally enjoying their meal before ending the event.
