 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the task of clearing the shipping mode, which requires a special shipment inquiry to determine if a special shipment is needed. If so, the process flows to the ExclusiveGateway1, where the user is prompted to select their offer. Following this, the goods are filled with a package note, and the process continues to InclusiveGateway2.

At InclusiveGateway2, the user is presented with the option to provide goods for collection or complete insurance, depending on their choice. If they choose to provide goods for collection, the process moves to Packaging goods, where the goods are packaged and sent to InclusiveGateway3. If they choose to complete insurance, the process moves directly to InclusiveGateway3.

Upon reaching InclusiveGateway3, the process concludes with the End event, marking the completion of the shipping process.
