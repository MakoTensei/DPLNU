 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the following sequence of tasks:

1. The 'Shipping goods' event initiates the 'Packaging goods' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway5'. The task then sends its output to 'ParallelGateway4'.

2. Concurrently, the 'Shipping goods' event also triggers the 'Notification of the shipping quantity' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway5'. This task sends its output to 'ParallelGateway6'.

3. The 'Notification of the shipping quantity' task, in turn, initiates the 'Ask Spediteur 1' and 'Ask Spediteur 2' tasks, both receiving input from 'ParallelGateway6'. These tasks then send their outputs to 'ParallelGateway7'.

4. The 'Ask Spediteur 1' and 'Ask Spediteur 2' tasks also trigger the 'Select a quote' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway7'. The 'Select a quote' task sends its output to 'Specialist'.

5. The 'Specialist' task, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway7', sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

6. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, upon receiving input from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'insurance', sends its output to 'Goods delivered'.

7. Finally, the 'Goods delivered' event, receiving input from 'ExclusiveGateway1', marks the end of the process.

This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures the smooth flow of goods from shipping to delivery, with each step being triggered by the previous one and passing its output to the next.
