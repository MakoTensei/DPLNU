 In the process of preparing Schufa scoring, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Prepare schufascoring' task. This task is responsible for setting up the initial conditions and data required for scoring. Once 'Prepare schufascoring' is completed, it sends an output to'sid-53634C9B-DCBF-4AAD-A853-A5F153CA50C7', which acts as an exclusive gateway, directing the flow to the 'Process Schufa message' task.

The 'Process Schufa message' task, identified by'sid-5D8AFBE0-287D-4628-AE6A-DEC31AAAECBA', takes in 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' as its incoming event and sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then routes the flow to either'sid-D74F61AD-8F70-4955-88F0-66CC76A3E9E5' or'sid-20CE2FCA-945A-4439-831B-62EAA2789810', depending on the specific processing required.

Simultaneously, another 'Process Schufa message' task, identified by'sid-917302E3-C4A2-47A4-ABD7-817273F071B2', also receives 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' as its incoming event and sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Level 1 scoring' task, identified by'sid-C2085DA5-9FA0-4CE9-A8C5-BE9F5F7BC585', is initiated by 'StartEvent1' and sends its output to 'Result Level 1'. This output is then directed to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which in turn sends the output to either'sid-271C0FD9-77D5-448C-
