 In the logistics process, various tasks and gateways are involved in handling large quantities of goods. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'large quantity?' gateway. This gateway requires 'Insurance required' and 'Insurance required' as its outgoing connections, ensuring that insurance is a priority for large shipments.

Once the insurance is in place, the 'Insurance required' gateway comes into play. It receives 'large quantity?' and 'StartEvent0' as incoming connections and sends out 'Info to warehouse workers' and 'Complete insurance' as outgoing connections. The 'Info to warehouse workers' task provides necessary information to the warehouse staff, while the 'Complete insurance' task finalizes the insurance process for the shipment.

Following the completion of insurance, the 'Pick up goods' gateway is activated. It receives 'Packaging goods' as an incoming connection and sends out 'Pick up offers' as an outgoing connection. This gateway is responsible for initiating the pickup process for the packaged goods.

The 'Pick up offers' gateway then connects to the 'Accept offer' gateway, which requires 'large quantity?' as an incoming connection and sends 'Accept offer' as an outgoing connection. This step involves accepting the pickup offer for the large quantity of goods.

After accepting the offer, the 'Select your offer' gateway is triggered, which receives 'Send a message' as an incoming connection and sends 'Select your offer' as an outgoing connection. This gateway allows the customer to choose the most suitable offer for their large shipment.

Once the offer is selected, the 'Create a quote' gateway is activated, which receives 'large quantity?' as an incoming connection and sends 'Create a quote' as an outgoing connection. This gateway generates a quote for the selected offer, providing the customer with a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.

The 'Send a message' gateway then connects to the 'Insurance required' gateway, which requires 'large quantity?' as an incoming connection and sends 'Insurance required' as an outgoing connection. This step ensures that insurance is still a priority for the large shipment.

The 'Complete insurance' gateway is triggered next, which receives 'StartEvent
