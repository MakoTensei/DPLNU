 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural flow description:

1. The process starts with the event 'Hunger', which triggers the guest to visit the restaurant.

2. Upon arrival, the guest selects a 'Court' to dine in.

3. The guest then places an 'Order request' to the restaurant staff, indicating their hunger and the type of food they desire.

4. The restaurant staff adds the guest's order to the system, and a 'Payment request' is initiated to process the payment for the meal.

5. The guest pays for the meal, and the staff prepares the food.

6. Once the food is ready, the staff 'Pick up food' and serves it to the guest.

7. After enjoying the meal, the guest expresses satisfaction with the 'Pieper sounds', indicating that the pieper (a type of food item) is ready to be served.

8. The staff 'Get Pieper' and delivers the pieper to the guest.

9. The guest consumes the pieper, and the staff 'Pick up food' again to serve the remaining meal.

10. The guest finishes eating and the staff cleans up the dining area.

11. The guest leaves the restaurant, and the staff 'Leave food' to ensure the area is clean and ready for the next guest.

12. The staff 'Inform employees' about the completed order and the guest's departure.

13. The 'EventBasedGateway0' receives the 'Answer' event from the staff, signaling the completion of the guest's order.

14. The 'EventBasedGateway0' processes the completed order and sends a 'Process completed' notification to the system.

15. The process ends with the 'Process completed' event, indicating that the guest's order has been successfully fulfilled and the restaurant staff can attend to the next guest.
