 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the 'Note\nDelay\nCreating' task, which then connects to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. Following this, the 'Scoring request' task is triggered, leading to the 'Scoring' task. Once the scoring is complete, the 'Continue Scoring Result' task is activated, resulting in the 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, the 'Delay\nobtained' task is completed, which also leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Subsequently, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Results?' task, which connects to the 'EventBasedGateway1' and'sid-065379A7-4735-4819-99C8-6D6E24BAC953'. The'second scoring' task, which is dependent on the'sid-12C678C0-8B91-480C-ACD6-A9A482B66623', concludes the process by triggering the 'EndEvent1'.
