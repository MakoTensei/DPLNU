 Upon receiving a 'Scoring request\nobtained', the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the request. First, a 'forward scoring request' is triggered, which is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then sends a 'Scoring request\nAnswer' back to the system. Concurrently, a 'Delay display' is activated, also pointing to 'ExclusiveGateway1', to hold the request temporarily.

Simultaneously, 'perform scoring level 2' is initiated, which sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway, in turn, sends a 'Scoring request\nAnswer' back to the system. Additionally, a 'Delay display' is activated, directing the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, 'perform scoring level 1' is also initiated, sending the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which responds with a 'Scoring request\nAnswer'. Furthermore, a 'Delay display' is activated, directing the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

In another scenario, when a 'Scoring request\nobtained' is received, the system triggers a'successful?' event, which sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway responds with a 'Scoring request\nAnswer' and also activates a 'Delay display'.

Lastly, when a 'Scoring request\nobtained' is received, the system triggers a 'immediate\nAnswer?' event, which sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway responds with a 'Scoring request\nAnswer' and also activates a 'Delay display'.

In summary, the system processes the 'Scoring request\nobtained' by initiating various tasks and events, directing them to different gateways, and ultimately providing a 'Scoring request\nAnswer' as the final output.
