 The process begins with the event 'Possible Regression' which triggers the 'Payment Report' task. This task is then connected to the 'Actual Regress?' gateway, which has two possible outcomes: 'No Regression' or 'Regression Delivered'. If 'No Regression' is the outcome, the process ends here. However, if 'Regression Delivered' is the outcome, the process continues to the 'Payment on a.send' task. This task is connected to the 'Possible Regression' gateway, which can lead to two outcomes: 'Regression Paid' or 'Regression Unfounded'. If 'Regression Paid' is the outcome, the process ends here. If 'Regression Unfounded' is the outcome, the process continues to the 'Opposition Report' task. This task is connected to the 'Set on re-submission' gateway, which can lead to two outcomes: 'Regression Unfounded' or 'Regression Delivered'. If 'Regression Unfounded' is the outcome, the process ends here. If 'Regression Delivered' is the outcome, the process continues to the 'Regression Delivered' task. This task is connected to the 'Event Based Gateway 3', which can lead to two outcomes: 'Regression Paid' or 'Regression Unfounded'. If 'Regression Paid' is the outcome, the process ends here. If 'Regression Unfounded' is the outcome, the process ends here.
