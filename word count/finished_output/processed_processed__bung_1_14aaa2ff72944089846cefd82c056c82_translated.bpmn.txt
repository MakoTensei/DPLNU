 The order process begins with the 'Order' start event, which triggers the 'Quantities Check' task through the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Quantities Check' task then sends the 'Order' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the 'Order' to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task sends the 'Order' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'Pick up offers' task through 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Pick up offers' task sends the 'Order' to the 'Specialist' task again, which then sends the 'Order' to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' sends the 'Order' to the 'Complete insurance' task, which then sends the 'Order' to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the 'Order' to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn sends the 'Order' to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' receives the 'Order' from 'ParallelGateway5' and completes the order process.
