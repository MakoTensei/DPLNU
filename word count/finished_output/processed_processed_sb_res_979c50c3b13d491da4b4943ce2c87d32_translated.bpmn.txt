 A customer feels hungry and decides to choose a special offer.

1. The customer expresses their hunger, triggering the "Hunger felt" start event.

2. The "Hunger felt" start event leads to the "Pieper triggered" event, as the customer decides to pick up food.

3. The "Pieper triggered" event results in the "Food consumed" end event, where the customer eats the food.

Alternatively,

1. The customer feels hungry and decides to choose a special offer.

2. The customer expresses their hunger, triggering the "Hunger felt" start event.

3. The "Hunger felt" start event leads to the "StartEvent1" event, which in turn triggers the "EventBasedGateway2" event.

4. The "EventBasedGateway2" event results in the "Pieper triggered" event, where the customer picks up food.

5. The "Pieper triggered" event leads to the "Food consumed" end event, where the customer eats the food.

In both scenarios, the customer's hunger leads to the selection of a special offer, picking up food, and ultimately consuming the food.
