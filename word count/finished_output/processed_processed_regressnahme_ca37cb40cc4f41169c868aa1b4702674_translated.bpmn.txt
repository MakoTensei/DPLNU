 When a possible regress is reported, the system initiates a check on the case, which is directed towards ExclusiveGateway1. If the opposition is deemed justifiable, the process is closed, and if not, the proceedings continue towards ExclusiveGateway3. The check on the case can also be triggered by an incoming payment event, which leads to ExclusiveGateway1. The process is ultimately concluded through EventBasedGateway4, which receives inputs from ExclusiveGateway1 and ExclusiveGateway3.
