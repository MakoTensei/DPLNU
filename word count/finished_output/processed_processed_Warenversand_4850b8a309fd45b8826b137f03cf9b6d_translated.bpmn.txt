 In the bustling world of logistics, a series of tasks and gateways work in harmony to ensure the smooth delivery of goods. Let's dive into the flow of operations:

1. When goods are ready for shipment, the process kicks off with the 'Packaging goods' task, which is triggered by the 'Goods\nShip ready\n' event. This task sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway5' for further processing.
