 When a 'Schufascoring requested' event occurs, it triggers a 'Report back delay' to ExclusiveGateway0. This is followed by an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' that leads to 'Scoring performed' through ExclusiveGateway2. Concurrently, a 'Scoring request started' event initiates a 'Report delay' and sets off 'EventBasedGateway3', which in turn performs 'Scoring performed'. Additionally, 'Conducting First Scoring' event sends 'perform scoring2' to ExclusiveGateway2, which also performs 'Scoring performed'. The 'Return Score' process is initiated by 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' and 'Scoring request started', both of which lead to 'Scoring performed' through ExclusiveGateway2. Lastly, 'Scoring performed' events are concluded with 'EventBasedGateway3' and 'Scoring takes place?' events, both of which have no outgoing connections.
