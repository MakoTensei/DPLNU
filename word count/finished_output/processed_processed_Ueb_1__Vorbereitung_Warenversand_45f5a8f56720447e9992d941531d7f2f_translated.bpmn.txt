 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers with three freight forwarders' task. This task involves selecting offers from three freight forwarders. Once an offer is selected, the process moves to the 'Filling the package note' task, which requires the 'Check for quantity' task to be completed first. After the package note is filled, the 'Provide goods for collection' task is initiated, which involves the 'Big crowd?' gateway.

The 'Big crowd?' gateway connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then leads to the 'Goods delivered' event, which requires the 'Insurance required?' gateway to be checked first. The 'Insurance required?' gateway connects to the 'Complete insurance' task, which in turn leads to the 'Goods delivered' event.

In summary, the process starts with shipping goods, followed by selecting offers, checking quantity, filling the package note, providing goods for collection, and finally delivering the goods with insurance.
