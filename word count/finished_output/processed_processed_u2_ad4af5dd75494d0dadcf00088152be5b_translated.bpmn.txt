 Upon receiving a report of a possible regression requirement, the system initiates an examination of the case. This triggers a message to be sent regarding the potential regression, which could lead to a reimbursement if the regression is confirmed. Concurrently, the system books money for the case, and an exclusive gateway is engaged to handle the case further.

The exclusive gateway, ExclusiveGateway3, receives the message about the possible regression and the reasons obtained from the examination. It then proceeds to close the case after processing the information.

Meanwhile, another exclusive gateway, ExclusiveGateway0, is activated to determine if the revocation is justified based on the report of the possible regression. If the revocation is justified, the system discloses the debt collection office.

If the regression is confirmed, the system sends a message to Regression possible? and proceeds to reimbursement. The reimbursement message is then directed to ExclusiveGateway0.

In summary, the system examines the case, sends messages regarding the possible regression, books money, and engages exclusive gateways to determine the next steps, which may include closing the case, disclosing the debt collection office, or reimbursing the involved parties.
