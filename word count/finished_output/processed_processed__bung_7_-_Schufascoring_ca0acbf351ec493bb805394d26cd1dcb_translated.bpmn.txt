 The process begins with a 'Scoring request' event, which triggers the 'Start Schufascoring process' task. This task initiates the scoring process and sends a 'Scoring request' to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Once the scoring process is initiated, 'Scoring calculation (level 1)' task is triggered, which calculates the initial scoring and sends the result to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Simultaneously, 'Send Level 2 scoring' task is triggered, which sends the initial scoring to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

After the initial scoring is obtained, 'Send delay message' task is triggered, which sends a delay message to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

'Send Level 2 scoring result' task is then triggered, which sends the Level 2 scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

'Send Level 2 scoring result' task is also triggered from 'ExclusiveGateway1', which sends the Level 2 scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

'Send delay message' task is triggered again, this time from 'ExclusiveGateway1', which sends a delay message to 'EventBasedGateway3'.

'Send Level 2 scoring result' task is triggered from 'ExclusiveGateway2', which sends the Level 2 scoring result to 'Process completed'.

'Get delay notification' task is triggered from 'EventBasedGateway3', which sends a delay notification to 'Send delay message'.

'Get Level 2 scoring' task is triggered from 'ExclusiveGateway0', which sends the Level 2 scoring to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The process concludes with the 'Process completed' event, which is triggered from 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EventBasedGateway3'. This event signifies the successful completion of the scoring process.
