 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the initiation of a special shipment. This event is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn initiates the 'Separation of shipment' task. The separated shipment then goes through 'Initate special shipment' at 'ParallelGateway6', leading to the creation of three instances of 'Request Spedition' tasks.

The first 'Request Spedition' task is followed by 'Select your offer' at 'ParallelGateway7', which then appoints 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The second and third 'Request Spedition' tasks also go through 'Select your offer' and are directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Filling the package note' task is triggered by 'Big crowd?' at 'ParallelGateway5', which then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Complete insurance' task is also triggered by 'Shipping ticket necessary?' at 'Big crowd?', and it goes through 'ExclusiveGateway2' and is followed by 'Packaged and ready for pickup'.

Finally, the 'Packaged and ready for pickup' task concludes the process, marking the end of the shipment process.
