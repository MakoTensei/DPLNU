 The process begins with the event 'VN can possibly regress', which triggers the 'Possibility for regression?' gateway. This gateway sends a 'Send a message' to the next task 'Check the case'. Upon completion of 'Check the case', the 'EventBasedGateway3' is triggered, leading to two possible outcomes: 'Regression successful' or 'Regression not justified'. If 'Regression successful' occurs, it results in 'Regression on debt collection service providers delivered'. Conversely, if 'Regression not justified' is the outcome, it leads to 'None regression possible'. This sequence of events and gateways ensures a structured flow of tasks and decisions based on the incoming and outgoing information.
