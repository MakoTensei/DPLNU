 The system initiates the process with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Send request' task, which checks for a result and if found, proceeds to 'Scoring Level 1' task, represented by 'StartEvent1'. This task, upon completion, triggers the 'Is there a result?' gateway, leading to 'EndEvent0' and subsequently 'Scoring Level 2' task, initiated by 'StartEvent1'. The 'Scoring Level 2' task, upon completion, sends the result to the 'Is there a result?' gateway, which then leads to 'EndEvent3'. Meanwhile, 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task, triggered by 'Scoring Level 1', sends the result to 'EndEvent1'. The 'Is there a result?' gateway, triggered by 'StartEvent1', also sends the result to 'EndEvent2'.
