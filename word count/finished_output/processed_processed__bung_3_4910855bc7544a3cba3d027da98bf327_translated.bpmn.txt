 Upon the arrival of a regress report, the process begins with the 'Regress report arrived' event. This triggers the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway, which has incoming connections from the regress report and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent0' and 'VN contradicts'.

If the regress report suggests a possible regression, the process moves to the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which has incoming connections from the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway and outgoing connections to 'Money received' and 'EndEvent2'.

If the regress report does not suggest a possible regression, the process moves to the 'Close' task, which has incoming connections from the 'Regress report arrived' event and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent0'.

If the VN contradicts the regress report, the process moves to the 'VN payment request' task, which has incoming connections from the 'VN contradicts' gateway and outgoing connections to 'Set process for resubmission' and 'EndEvent2'.

The 'Set process for resubmission' task, upon receiving the 'Regression\npossible?' gateway, moves to the 'Money received' task, which has incoming connections from the 'Set process for resubmission' task and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent3'.

The 'Money received' task, upon receiving the 'Set process for resubmission' task, moves to the 'Close the process' task, which has incoming connections from the 'Money received' task and outgoing connections to 'EndEvent3'.

The 'Close the process' task, upon receiving the 'Money received' task, moves to the 'EndEvent3' task, which has incoming connections from the 'Close the process' task and outgoing connections to nothing.

If the VN contradicts the regress report, the process moves to the 'Examination' task, which has incoming connections from the 'VN contradicts' gateway and outgoing connections to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'EndEvent2'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task, upon receiving the 'Examination' task, moves to the 'EndEvent2' task, which has incoming connections from the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task and outgoing connections to nothing
