 Let's start with the event where a regression possibility report is received:

1. The 'Regression possibility\nReport' event triggers the 'Send payment prompt' task, which is connected to the 'Possibility?' gateway.

2. The 'Possibility?' gateway then directs the task to the 'Set case on WV' gateway, which in turn sends a 'Money received' event to the 'Book money' task.

3. The 'Book money' task, upon receiving the 'Money received' event, sends a 'Close' event to the 'Case processed without cash receipt' task.

4. The 'Case processed without cash receipt' task, after being closed, sends an 'ExclusiveGateway3' event to the 'Close' task.

5. The 'Close' task, upon receiving the 'ExclusiveGateway3' event, closes the case.

Now, let's consider the event where a case is forwarded to debt collection:

1. The 'EventBasedGateway4' event triggers the 'forward case to debt collection' task, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway.

2. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway then directs the task to the 'Case processed without cash receipt' task.

3. The 'Case processed without cash receipt' task, after being processed, sends a 'Case further' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway, upon receiving the 'Case further' event, sends a 'Case further' event to the 'Case further' task.

5. The 'Case further' task, after being forwarded, sends a 'Case edited with cash receipt' event to the 'Close' task.

6. The 'Close' task, upon receiving the 'Case edited with cash receipt' event, closes the case.

This flow ensures that the case is processed and closed appropriately, with the necessary actions taken based on the incoming events and the connections between tasks and gateways.
