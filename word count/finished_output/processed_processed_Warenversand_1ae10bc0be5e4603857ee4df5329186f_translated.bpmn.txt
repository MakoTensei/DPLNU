 Starting with the event 'Goods ready for dispatch', the process begins with the 'ExclusiveGateway1' which receives the incoming task and sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the 'Packaging goods' task is triggered, which in turn sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'Spediteur commission' task is also initiated due to the 'A lot?' incoming task, which sends the commission to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Once the goods are dispatched, the 'Postal mail' event occurs, leading to the 'Goods delivered' event, marking the end of the process.
