 When goods are sent overseas, the process begins with an inquiry about the necessary special delivery, which connects to the Special Delivery Gateway. This inquiry may also trigger a check for the goods insurance requirement, leading to the Exclusive Gateway 2. Once the insurance requirement is confirmed, the process continues to Exclusive Gateway 3, which then connects to Parallel Gateway 5.

Parallel Gateway 4 is involved when goods are ready to be sent, and it connects to the Filling Standard Package Voucher process. This process requires checking the goods insurance requirement, which again leads to Exclusive Gateway 2. After completing the insurance check, the goods are ready for dispatch, and the process concludes at Parallel Gateway 5, which then connects to the Goods Ready for Dispatch process.

In summary, the flow of events is as follows:

1. Goods are sent overseas, triggering an inquiry about special delivery.
2. The inquiry connects to the Special Delivery Gateway, which also connects to the Exclusive Gateway 2.
3. The Exclusive Gateway 2 checks the goods insurance requirement and connects to Exclusive Gateway 3.
4. Exclusive Gateway 3 connects to Parallel Gateway 5.
5. Parallel Gateway 4 connects to the Filling Standard Package Voucher process, which requires checking the goods insurance requirement and connects to Exclusive Gateway 2.
6. After completing the insurance check, the goods are ready for dispatch, and the process concludes at Parallel Gateway 5, which then connects to the Goods Ready for Dispatch process.
