 In the process of handling a request from a VM, the system initiates a series of tasks and interactions between various components and gateways.

Firstly, the system receives a request from the VM and sends a reply to the VM, indicating that it is preparing and performing the Schufa request. This interaction is captured by the task with ID'sid-F7BEDDA1-9529-4AFC-9FD8-3DE42FC87DB7'.

Next, the system reports a delay to the VM, which is represented by the task with ID'sid-E39B6A00-F941-47BC-BC0B-28647CB1A949'.

Simultaneously, the system also prepares and performs the Schufa request, which is represented by the task with ID'sid-F64835BF-1D2D-4B32-8945-2CB93DB6A0B7'. This task interacts with the IntermediateCatchEvent5, which is a gateway that connects the tasks and sends the request to the ExclusiveGateway0.

The ExclusiveGateway0 then receives the request and sends a Level 2 Get reply to the VM, as well as an IntermediateCatchEvent6. The task with ID'sid-D557019E-44E9-4862-B45E-614506983D28' represents this interaction.

Meanwhile, the system also determines if scoring is possible and will be determined, which is represented by the task with ID'sid-0F7F7C61-A6D5-4D51-A4BD-0E0B8304EDE6'. This task interacts with the Scoring was possible\nwill be determined? gateway, which sends a reply to the VM and a Scoring result sent to the scoring result sent task.

The scoring result sent task interacts with the ParallelGateway3, which sends the scoring result to the VM. This interaction is represented by the task with ID'sid-35
