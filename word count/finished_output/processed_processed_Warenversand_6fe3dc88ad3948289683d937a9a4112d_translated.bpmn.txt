 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Shopping (3)' task, which in turn leads to the 'Shopping (3)' task being routed to the 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway then sends the 'Shopping (3)' task to the 'Select offers' task, which requires the 'Select offers' task to receive input from the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task is then routed back to the 'Select offers' task.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also sends the 'Shopping (3)' task to the 'ParallelGateway3'. This gateway sends the 'Shopping (3)' task to the 'Packing goods' task, which then sends the 'Packing goods' task to the 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'ParallelGateway3' sends the 'Packing goods' task to the 'Delivering goods' task, which then sends the 'Delivering goods' task to the 'Finland' endpoint.

The 'Insurance required' task is triggered by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends the 'Insurance required' task to the 'Complete insurance' task, which then sends the 'Complete insurance' task back to the 'Insurance required' task.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Shopping (3)' task. This task is then routed to the 'ParallelGateway2', which sends the task to the 'Select offers' task. The 'Select offers' task requires input from the 'Specialist' task, which is routed back to the 'Select offers' task. The 'Shopping (3)' task is also sent to the 'ParallelGateway3', which sends the task to the 'Packing goods' task. The 'Packing goods' task is then sent to the 'Delivering goods' task, which sends the task to the 'Finland' endpoint. The 'Insurance required' task is triggered by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and sends the task to the 'Complete insurance' task, which then sends the task back to the 'Insurance required' task.
