 In the credit application process, the system initiates with a 'Credit Application' event, which triggers a 'Loan release obtained' task. This task is then followed by a 'Scoring request obtained' event, leading to the 'Scoring 1 Ergenis' task. The 'Scoring 1 Ergenis' task is then succeeded by a 'Scoring result obtained' event, which in turn triggers the 'Close' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Credit Application' event also triggers an 'Information forwarding' task, which is followed by a 'Kreidit release obtained' event. This event then leads to the 'Close' task.

The 'Scoring request obtained' event also triggers the 'Schufa show enroll' task, which is followed by a 'Scoring result obtained' event, leading to the 'Close' task.

The 'Approval' event triggers the 'Finished' task, and the 'Scoring result obtained' event also triggers the 'Close' task.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, triggered by the 'Credit Application' event, also leads to the 'Close' task.

In summary, the credit application process involves multiple tasks and events, including 'Credit Application', 'Loan release obtained', 'Scoring request obtained', 'Scoring 1 Ergenis', 'Information forwarding', 'Kreidit release obtained', 'Schufa show enroll', 'Approval', and 'Finished', all leading to the 'Close' task.
