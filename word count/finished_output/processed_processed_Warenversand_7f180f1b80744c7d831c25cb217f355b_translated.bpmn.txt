 Let's start the process with selecting your offer. You'll be directed to ParallelGateway8, which will then connect you to a Specialist. The Specialist will handle the filling of the package note, which involves communication with ParallelGateway5.

Once the package note is filled, you'll be directed to ExclusiveGateway3. Here, you'll request a quote from Spediteur 1, Spediteur 2, and Spediteur 3, all of which will use ParallelGateway8 as their entry point.

After receiving the quotes, you'll proceed to ExclusiveGateway2, where you'll complete the insurance process. This will lead you to ParallelGateway5, which will then connect you to ParallelGateway9 for packaging the goods.

The packaged goods will be delivered by a Specialist, who will initiate the delivery process at StartEvent0. The delivery will conclude at EndEvent0, where ParallelGateway9 will be the last point of contact.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. Select your offer -> ParallelGateway8 -> Specialist
2. Filling the package note -> Specialist -> ParallelGateway5
3. Request a quote -> ParallelGateway8 -> Spediteur 1, Spediteur 2, Spediteur 3
4. Complete insurance -> ExclusiveGateway2 -> ParallelGateway5
5. Packaging goods -> Specialist -> ParallelGateway5 -> ParallelGateway9
6. Delivering goods -> StartEvent0 -> Specialist -> EndEvent0

This process ensures a smooth and efficient flow of tasks, from selecting an offer to delivering the goods.
