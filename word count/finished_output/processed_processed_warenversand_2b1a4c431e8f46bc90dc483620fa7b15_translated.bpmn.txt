 In the process of handling a special shipment, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Special delivery' task. This task is managed by the 'ParallelGateway4' and has two outgoing paths: 'Pick up quotes' and 'Packaging goods'. The 'Pick up quotes' task is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway0', which subsequently leads to the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task. This task has an outgoing path to the 'Specialist' task, which is managed by 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Packaging goods' task, also originating from 'ParallelGateway4', is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task leads to the 'Insurance close' task, which has two outgoing paths: 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is responsible for determining whether insurance is necessary for the shipment, and if so, it leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. On the other hand, the 'ParallelGateway5' task is responsible for preparing the goods for collection.

Once the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task is completed, the 'Specialist' task is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Packaging goods' task. This task is managed by 'ParallelGateway5', which has an outgoing path to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the special shipment process involves several tasks and gateways, including 'StartEvent0', 'Special delivery', 'Pick up quotes', 'Choose the cheapest offer', 'Specialist', 'Insurance close', 'Packaging goods', and 'EndEvent0'. The workflow is managed by 'ParallelGateway4', 'ExclusiveGateway0', 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'ExclusiveGateway2', and 'ExclusiveGateway3', ensuring a smooth and efficient process for handling special shipments.
