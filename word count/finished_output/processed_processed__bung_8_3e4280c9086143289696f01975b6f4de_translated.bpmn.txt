 Let's start with the process of selecting a court to address hunger:

1. The individual experiences hunger, triggering the event 'Hunger' (sid-A7437303-D9CD-4D01-AB7A-C306FC15CF98).
2. This event leads to the 'Get Pieper' action (sid-401BB282-C9D0-4F57-A205-FBF88260F925), where the individual requests a court to handle their hunger.
3. The request is received by the 'EventBasedGateway0' (sid-C8896210-CFCE-4788-9C23-988FE03A99BC), which connects the individual to the court system.
4. The 'Order to receive' event (sid-401BB282-C9D0-4F57-A205-FBF88260F925) is sent to the court, indicating the individual's need for food.
5. The court system processes the request and prepares the court in high places (sid-7C63ECEA-511A-42C0-B11E-F892C54AF0AD).
6. The prepared court is ready to serve food (sid-E998A4C0-D65C-4C82-AADA-D8F4172A1881).
7. The 'Food served' event (sid-ED12C8A7-0221-4A8D-846A-7AE5EA3A13DF) occurs when the court serves the prepared meals to the individual.
8. The individual's hunger is satisfied, and the 'Famine' event (sid-39CB30B0-40EB-497A-8897-4B16AD3C3E04) is triggered, indicating that the individual no longer
