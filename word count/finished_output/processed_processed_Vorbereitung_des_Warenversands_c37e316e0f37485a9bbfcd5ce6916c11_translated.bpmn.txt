 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Competent authority' to initiate the process. The 'Competent authority' then sends the 'Quantity' to the 'Quantity' gateway, which in turn decides whether insurance is necessary. If insurance is needed, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Insurance necessary?' question is answered.

If insurance is not necessary, the 'Quantity' is sent to the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' sends the 'Quantity' to the 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway5' leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

On the other hand, if insurance is necessary, the 'Quantity' is sent to the 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' sends the 'Quantity' to the 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway5' leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Pick up offers' which sends the 'Special offer' to the 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then sends the 'Special offer' to the 'ParallelGateway5' which leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Filling the package note' task sends the 'Quantity' to the 'ParallelGateway6' and 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'ParallelGateway6' leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Packaging goods' task sends the 'Quantity' to both 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' sends the 'Quantity' to the 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway5' leads to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'ParallelGateway3' sends the 'Quantity' to the 'ParallelGateway6' which leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

Lastly, the 'Complete insurance' task sends the 'Insurance necessary?' question to the
