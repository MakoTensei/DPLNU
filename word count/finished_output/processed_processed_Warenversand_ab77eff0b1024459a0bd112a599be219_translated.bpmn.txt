 In the logistics process, a series of tasks are carried out to ensure the smooth transportation of goods. The process begins with the event 'Goods to be sent', which triggers the selection of a freight forwarder through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway connects to 'ParallelGateway6', where a request for a quote from Spediteur 1 is made. Concurrently, an offer is sent out.


Once the quote is received, the process continues with 'Select your offer' through 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to the selection of freight forwarders. The selected freight forwarder, 'ParallelGateway7', is then used to fill the package note, ensuring all necessary details are included.


Following the package note completion, 'ParallelGateway7' sends the goods for dispatch, marking the end of the process with the event 'Goods ready for dispatch'. Throughout this process, the various gateways and tasks ensure that the goods are properly insured, packaged, and ready for their journey.
