 When a "Report Regression Case" is initiated, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways. First, the "Case Check" task is activated, which then leads to a "Regression Possible?" gateway. If the gateway determines that a regression is possible, it sends a "Sending Payment Request" task. Concurrently, the "Money What?" gateway is also triggered, which results in a "Process Close" task.

Meanwhile, the "Regression Case" also triggers a "Reimbursement" task, which in turn leads to the "Opposition Available?" gateway. If the gateway determines that an opposition is available, it sends a "Process Close" task and a "Collection Forward" task.

If the "Regression Case" does not lead to a "Regression Possible?" or "Opposition Available?", the "Money What?" gateway sends a "Process Close" task.

The "Report Regression Case" task also triggers a "Process Close" task directly.

In summary, the "Report Regression Case" initiates a series of tasks and gateways, leading to various outcomes based on the results of the gateways. The "Sending Payment Request" and "Process Close" tasks are directly linked to the "Regression Possible?" gateway, while the "Money What?" gateway can lead to a "Process Close" task. The "Opposition Available?" gateway can result in a "Process Close" and "Collection Forward" task. Finally, the "Report Regression Case" task itself can also trigger a "Process Close" task.
