 In the process of handling a regression case, the workflow begins with the event 'Regression\nfeasible', which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway determines if the regression is feasible and, if so, proceeds to the 'Dispense process to Inkasso-DL' task, resulting in the 'Process\nDL delivered' event.

If the regression is not feasible, the 'Regression\nfeasible' event leads to the 'Regression\npracticable?' gateways. If the regression is deemed practical, the process continues to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then checks for 'Opposition\ninlaid'. If there is no opposition, the 'Check regression case' task is executed, and the process eventually closes with the 'Process\nclosed' event.

On the other hand, if the regression is not practical, the 'Regression\npracticable?' gateways will lead to the 'Opposition\njustified?' event. If the opposition is justified, the process will close with the 'Process\nclosed' event. If the opposition is not justified, the 'ExclusiveGateway3' will be triggered, and the 'Dispense process to Inkasso-DL' task will be executed, resulting in the 'Process\nDL delivered' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Regression\nfeasible' event, which leads to either the 'ExclusiveGateway3' or the 'Regression\npracticable?' gateways, depending on the feasibility of the regression. The outcomes of these gateways determine the subsequent tasks and events, ultimately leading to the closure of the process or the delivery of the DL.
