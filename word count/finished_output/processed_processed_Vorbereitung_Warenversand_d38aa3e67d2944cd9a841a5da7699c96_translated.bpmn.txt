 The shipping process begins when goods are to be shipped, which triggers the 'Goods are to be shipped' start event. This event has two outgoing paths: 'Packaging goods' and 'Filling parcel note'. 

The 'Packaging goods' task is associated with 'ParallelGateway6', which in turn has an outgoing path to 'Delivering orders'. This task is also linked to 'Test Shipping quantity', which goes to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'Filling parcel note' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which has an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task is also linked to 'Insurance requirements', which goes to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Insurance requirements' task is also connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which has an outgoing path to 'ParallelGateway7'. This task is also linked to 'Insurance', which goes to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task is also connected to 'Special delivery', which has an outgoing path to 'ExclusiveGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway4' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway6', which has an outgoing path to 'Delivering orders'. This task is also linked to 'Test Shipping quantity', which goes to 'ExclusiveGateway4'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'Special delivery', which have outgoing paths to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'EndEvent0', respectively.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway7' and 'Special delivery', which have outgoing paths to 'Delivering orders'.

In summary, the shipping process involves packaging goods, filling parcel notes, handling insurance requirements, and delivering orders, all of which are coordinated through various gateways and tasks.
