 In the scoring system, the process begins with a 'Schufascoring request' that triggers a series of events and interactions between different components.

1. The 'Schufascoring request' initiates the process and sends a message to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway is responsible for handling the incoming request and routing it to the appropriate components.

2. The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Schufascoring request' and sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway is responsible for managing the flow of messages between the different components.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the message from the 'EventBasedGateway1' and sends a 'Get delay message' to the 'Results obtained' component. This component is responsible for obtaining the results of the scoring process.

4. The 'Results obtained' component receives the 'Get delay message' and sends a 'Report result to Frontend' message to the 'EndEvent0'. This event signifies the completion of the scoring process and the availability of the scoring result.

5. Meanwhile, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' also sends a 'Report bank delay' message to the 'perform scoring level 2' component. This component is responsible for handling the bank-related scoring process.

6. The 'perform scoring level 2' component receives the 'Report bank delay' message and sends a 'Bank Report result' message to the 'EndEvent2'. This event signifies the completion of the bank-related scoring process and the availability of the bank report result.

7. The 'EndEvent2' sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then sends a 'Bank Report result' message to the 'EndEvent3'. This event signifies the completion of the bank-related scoring process and the availability of the bank report result.

8. The 'EndEvent3' sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then sends a 'Report result to Frontend' message to the 'Results obtained' component. This event signifies the completion of the bank-related scoring process and the availability of the bank report result.

9. The 'Results obtained' component receives the
