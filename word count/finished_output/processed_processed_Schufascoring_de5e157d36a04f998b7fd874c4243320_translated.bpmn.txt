 The workflow begins with the 'Start\nSchufascoring' event, which triggers the 'Scoring\nSend an inquiry to Shufa' task. This task sends an inquiry to Shufa and then transitions to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task. Upon completion of 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', the workflow proceeds to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which is initiated by the 'Start Scoring' event. The 'Level 1 Scoring' task then moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', where it eventually concludes with the 'End of scoring' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring\nSend an inquiry to Shufa' task also leads to the 'EventBasedGateway3', which in turn sends the inquiry to Shufa and ends with the 'End\nScore determination' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Start Scoring' event also triggers the 'Transfer scoring results' task, which is initiated by the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task concludes with the 'End of scoring' event.

Additionally, the 'Start Scoring' event also leads to the 'Information about delayed scoring' task, which is initiated by the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task concludes with the 'Level 2 Scoring' event.

In summary, the workflow involves multiple tasks and gateways, with the 'Start\nSchufascoring' and 'Start Scoring' events initiating the process. The 'Scoring\nSend an inquiry to Shufa' task connects the workflow to the 'EventBasedGateway3', while the 'Transfer scoring results' task and 'Information about delayed scoring' task are connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The workflow concludes with the 'End of scoring' and 'End\nScore determination' events.
