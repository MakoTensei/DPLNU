 The workflow begins with the 'Regression' process, which is triggered by the 'Regression' start event. This process checks for any regression issues and has incoming connections from 'Check regression' and 'Reimbursement'. Once the 'Check regression' task is completed, it moves to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', which is an exclusive gateway that connects to 'Regression finished' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' end events. The 'Reimbursement' task also connects to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'.

After 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', the process moves to 'Book money' task, which is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task books money and has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'Book money' task then moves to 'EndEvent1', which is the end event for this process.

Simultaneously, the 'Testing objection' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway1' and has incoming connections from 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task tests objections and moves to 'EndEvent2', which is the end event for this process.

Lastly, the 'Debt securities' task is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2' and has no outgoing connections. This task deals with debt securities and does not have any specific end event.

In summary, the workflow consists of the 'Regression' process, 'Book money' task, and 'Testing objection' task, all triggered by different exclusive gateways and connected to their respective end events.
