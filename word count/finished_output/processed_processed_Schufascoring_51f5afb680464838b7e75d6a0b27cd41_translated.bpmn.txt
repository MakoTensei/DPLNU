 When a scoring request is obtained, it triggers a series of events and interactions between different components in the system. The process begins with the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event, which initiates the scoring process. This event is received by the 'StartEvent1' and sends an incoming message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then processes the incoming message and sends an outgoing message to the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task. This task is responsible for conducting the initial level of scoring. Once the task is completed, it sends an outgoing message to the 'EndEvent1', signaling the end of the first level of scoring.

Meanwhile, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' also sends an outgoing message to the 'Report delay' task, which is triggered by the 'Report delay' event. This task is responsible for handling any delays in the scoring process.

After the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task completes, the 'Report delay' task sends an outgoing message to the 'EndEvent1', signaling the end of the delay handling.

The 'EndEvent1' then sends an outgoing message to the 'Results available' gateway, which is responsible for making the scoring results available. The 'Results available' gateway receives the message and sends an outgoing message to the 'Scoring result\nobtained' task, which obtains the final scoring result.

Finally, the 'Scoring result\nobtained' task sends an outgoing message to the 'EndEvent0', signaling the end of the scoring process and the availability of the scoring result.

In summary, the scoring process begins with the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event, which triggers a series of events and interactions between different components in the system, ultimately leading to the obtainment of the final scoring result.
