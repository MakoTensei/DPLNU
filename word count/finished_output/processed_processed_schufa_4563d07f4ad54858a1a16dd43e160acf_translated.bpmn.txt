 In a scoring system, the process begins with a StartEvent0, which triggers the Advanced Scoring task (sid-2BF15096-A42D-4044-A750-DBD38C5C98A9) that takes input from a Delay? event (sid-0EFAB1B4-1BE8-4D14-BCD1-937A399F6208). This Advanced Scoring task then passes its output to an ExclusiveGateway1 (sid-3813B305-0346-49EE-AF3F-725E16BCD9FB), which in turn receives inputs from both the Delay? event and ParallelGateway2 (sid-8D06D6AE-EE0B-4F4A-ADC4-A6D628F8CC6F). The ExclusiveGateway1 ultimately leads to the EndEvent0 (sid-A8864E05-C341-4128-A6CF-9D58A0BCA767).

Meanwhile, the IntermediateCatchEvent3 (sid-07197A99-BD2C-44B5-9103-529DEFFA049A) and IntermediateCatchEvent4 (sid-A57F11C5-A27E-47F3-93E7-30B4F6DFF6D0) are separate events that do not directly interact with the scoring process.
