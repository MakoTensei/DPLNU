 The process begins with the event 'Schufa scoring-\nRequest required', which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to forward the 'Scoring result forwarded' to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, the 'Schufa scoring\nrequested' event initiates the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to send the 'Level2 send result' to the 'Level2Result\nReport'. The 'Results available?' event then prompts the 'Level2 send result' to forward the 'Scoring\nresult determined' to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Finally, the 'Scoring result forwarded' event concludes the process by sending the 'Scoring result forwarded' to the 'EventBasedGateway3'.
