 In a system designed to handle various tasks and events, there are several key components that work together to ensure smooth operation. Let's explore the flow of tasks and events in this system:

The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Send a request' task. This task sends a request to the frontend and is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then decides the next course of action based on the incoming request.

If the request is to send a result to the frontend, the 'Send result to the frontend' task is triggered, and the result is sent to the frontend. This task is connected to the 'Results available?' event, which signifies that the result is ready to be sent.

Alternatively, if the request is to send a delay to the frontend, the 'Send delay to Frontend' task is triggered. This task sends a delay message to the frontend and is connected to the 'Delay' event.

The 'Delay' event is also connected to the 'EventBasedGateway2', which can handle the delay message and send it to the appropriate destination.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which calculates the results and sends a message to the 'Results available?' event. This event is connected to the 'Send result to the bank' task, which sends the results to the bank.

The 'Send result to the bank' task is also connected to the 'EndEvent1', which signifies that the results are ready to be sent to the bank.

Simultaneously, the 'Level 1 Scoring' task can also trigger the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which sends the results to the bank. This task is connected to the 'Results available?' event and the 'Send result to the bank' task.

The 'Results available?' event is also connected to the 'EndEvent2', which signifies that the results are ready to be sent to the bank.

In summary, the system handles various tasks and events, such as sending requests, results, and delays to the frontend, and sending results to the bank. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'EventBasedGateway
