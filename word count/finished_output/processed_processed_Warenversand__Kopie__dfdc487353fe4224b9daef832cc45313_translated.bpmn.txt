 When goods are ready for shipping, the process begins with a request for the type of shipping, which determines the shipping mode and influences the subsequent decisions. This request is directed to the 'Type of shipping?' gateway, which then connects to either ExclusiveGateway3 or DECISIONS based on the chosen shipping method.

If insurance is required, the process involves a decision at the 'Insurance required?' gateway, which connects to ExclusiveGateway2. This gateway then leads to the 'Packed goods are ready for collection' event, indicating that the goods are prepared for collection with insurance coverage.

Alternatively, if insurance is not required, the process proceeds to the 'Select shipping mode' gateway, which connects to ExclusiveGateway3. This gateway then leads to the 'Packed goods are ready for collection' event, indicating that the goods are prepared for collection without insurance.

In both scenarios, the 'Packed goods are ready for collection' event is the final step in the process, marking the completion of the packaging and preparation of goods for shipping.
