 In the bustling world of a gourmet restaurant, a series of events unfold to ensure a seamless dining experience. The process begins when a customer places an order for gastronomy, triggering the 'Gastronomy' start event. This event sets off a chain reaction, leading to the 'Pick up food' task, where the kitchen staff prepares the meal.

Once the food is ready, the 'Pick up food' task sends a signal to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1' gateway.
