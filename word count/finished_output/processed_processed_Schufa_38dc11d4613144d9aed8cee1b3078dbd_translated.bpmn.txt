 In our system, we have a process that begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring inquiries' task. This task then leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which is responsible for handling the scoring inquiries and ultimately ends with 'EndEvent0'. 

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Scoring Level 1' task, which is followed by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. This event is responsible for handling the scoring level 1 and concludes with 'EndEvent2'. 

Lastly, 'StartEvent1' also triggers the 'Scoring Level 2' task, which is handled by the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' and ends with 'EndEvent2'. This process ensures that all scoring inquiries and levels are efficiently managed and resolved.
