 In the process of scoring and communication within a system, a Schufascoring request initiates the workflow. This request triggers a series of events and interactions between different components, such as gateways and tasks, to ensure a smooth and efficient process.

When a Schufascoring request is received, the first step is to check for any communication delays. This is done through the 'Is there a delay?' gateway, which has two outgoing paths: 'EndEvent3' and 'Determine Final Scoring'. If there is a delay, the process moves to the 'Communication delay' task, which handles the delay and eventually leads to the 'EndEvent3' event.

If there is no delay, the process proceeds to the 'How to communicate' task, which has two incoming paths: 'Schufascoring request' and 'Is there a delay?'. The task's output is 'EndEvent3', which connects to the 'Determine Final Scoring' event.

The 'Determine Final Scoring' event has two incoming paths: 'Is there a delay?' and 'EndEvent3'. If there is a delay, the process moves to the 'Report delay' task, which has an outgoing path to 'perform second scoring (level 2)'. If there is no delay, the process moves to the 'perform second scoring (level 2)' task, which has an outgoing path to 'Determine Final Scoring'.

The 'Determine Final Scoring' event has two incoming paths: 'Is there a delay?' and 'perform second scoring (level 2)'. If there is a delay, the process moves to the'sid-434B3A89-0E04-425D-80C0-8CC7C17F6F12' task, which has an output of 'Process completed'. If there is no delay, the process moves to the'sid-5FB66261-EA2C-442F-925B-210CFDAB7B2F' task, which also has an output of 'Process completed'.

In summary, the process starts with a Schufascoring request, which may or may not have a communication delay. If there
