 When goods are to be shipped, the process begins with the Secretariat checking dispatch, which involves verifying if insurance is necessary. This task is directed to ExclusiveGateway0, where the decision is made whether insurance is required. If insurance is deemed necessary, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway2, where the filling of the package certificate for normal shipping takes place.


Simultaneously, ParallelGateway4 is responsible for picking up offers, which leads to the selection of a suitable offer. Once an offer is chosen, the process moves to Appoint forwarding, which is directed to ExclusiveGateway3.


In parallel, the shipping process is initiated at ParallelGateway5, where the goods are sent. This is also where the packaging of goods occurs, which is directed to ParallelGateway4.


After the goods are dispatched, the Logistics Manager closes the insurance, which is directed to ExclusiveGateway2.


The process concludes when the goods are sent, which is the final event in the workflow. This event is triggered by ParallelGateway4 and signifies the completion of the shipping process.
