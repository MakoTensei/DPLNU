 1. A guest arrives at the court feeling hungry but has no specific order yet.
2. The guest decides to add their order, which is not specified at this moment.
3. The guest places their order, triggering the event "Order Obtained."
4. The event "Order Obtained" activates the Event-Based Gateway 0, which sends the guest to the "Pick up Pieper" line and informs them that they will have to wait for 5 minutes.
5. The guest waits for 5 minutes and is then directed to the "Pieper over" line.
6. At the "Pieper over" line, the guest receives their pieper and their hunger is distilled.
7. The guest is then informed that they can proceed to the "Court of Justice" to have their order executed.
8. In the "Court of Justice," the guest's order is processed, and they are informed that their order is ready.
9. The guest is then directed to the "Guest appears" line, where they are informed that they can pick up their pieper.
10. The guest picks up their pieper, and their hunger is distilled.
11. The guest is then directed to the "Retrieve guest" line, where they are informed that they will be retrieving the guest in 5 minutes.
12. After 5 minutes, the guest is retrieved and the process concludes with the guest's hunger being distilled.

This flowchart describes the guest's journey from arriving hungry at the court to having their pieper and satisfying their hunger. The process involves various lines and gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for the guest.
