 When you feel hungry, you can select a court (Task6) to place your order. After placing your order, you will be prompted to pay for it. Once the payment is complete, you will receive your pieper (food). After eating the pieper, you can pick up another pieper for more food.

To start the process, you can express your hunger, which will trigger Task6, where you can select a court to place your order. After receiving your order, you will be directed to the cash register system to enter your order. Once the order is received, you will be prompted to pay for it.

After paying for your order, you will be directed to pick up your pieper. Once you have picked up your pieper, you can eat it, which will trigger the consumption of food. After eating, you can pick up another pieper for more food.

The process is managed by an EventBasedGateway0, which handles hunger and food consumption. The IntermediateCatchEvent2 is responsible for delivering the food to the guest. The process ends when the food is consumed or when the orders are made in full.
