 When a scoring request is initiated, it triggers the StartEvent0, which then leads to the Report scoring process. This process involves two levels of scoring: Conduct scoring (level 1) and Conduct scoring (level 2). The Scoring Report from both levels is sent to the ExclusiveGateway1, which subsequently directs the Scoring completed event to the EndEvent1.

Simultaneously, the Report delay event is triggered by the EventBasedGateway2, which handles the delay in the scoring process. This event is connected to both the ParallelGateway3 and ParallelGateway4, which manage the delay and scoring completion respectively.

In summary, the scoring process begins with the StartEvent0, leading to the Report scoring process. The Scoring Report from both levels is sent to the ExclusiveGateway1, which directs the Scoring completed event to the EndEvent1. Meanwhile, the Report delay event is managed by the EventBasedGateway2, which is connected to the ParallelGateway3 and ParallelGateway4 to handle the delay and scoring completion.
