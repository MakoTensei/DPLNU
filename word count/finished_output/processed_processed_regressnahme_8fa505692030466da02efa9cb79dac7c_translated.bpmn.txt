 In a case study process, the following sequence of tasks and gateways are involved:

1. The process starts with a Regression event, which triggers EventBasedGateway6.
2. EventBasedGateway6 receives the Regression event and forwards it to ExclusiveGateway4.
3. ExclusiveGateway4 receives the Regression event and forwards it to Case study.
4. Case study receives the Regression event and sends a payment request to Send payment request\n.
5. Send payment request\n receives the Regression event and sends a Set on re-submission to EndEvent1.
6. EndEvent1 receives the Set on re-submission event and ends the process.

Simultaneously, the process also involves the following tasks and gateways:

1. Rethink event triggers IntermediateCatchEvent8, which forwards it to Debt collection office\nforward.
2. Debt collection office\nforward receives the IntermediateCatchEvent8 and sends it to ExclusiveGateway4.
3. ExclusiveGateway4 receives the IntermediateCatchEvent8 and forwards it to Proceedings\n.
4. Proceedings\n receives the IntermediateCatchEvent8 and forwards it to ExclusiveGateway4.
5. ExclusiveGateway4 receives the Proceedings\n event and forwards it to EndEvent2.
6. EndEvent2 receives the Proceedings\n event and ends the process.

In summary, the case study process involves a Regression event that triggers a series of tasks and gateways, leading to the closure of the case. Simultaneously, a separate process involving the rethink event also runs, leading to the closure of a different process.
