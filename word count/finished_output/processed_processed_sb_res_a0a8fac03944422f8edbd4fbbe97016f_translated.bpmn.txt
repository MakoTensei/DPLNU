 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and flowing description:

1. When a customer feels hungry, the system triggers the event 'Hunger felt' and sends a request to select a court.
2. The system selects the court and sends a request to order food.
3. The court orders the food, and the system sends a notification to prepare the meal.

Parallelly:

1. The court order triggers the event 'court order' and sends a request to hand over the meal.
2. The system prepares the meal and sends a notification to inform the employees.

After the meal is prepared:

1. The event 'Prepared meals' is triggered, and the system notifies the employees.

In case of hunger:

1. The event 'Hunger felt' is triggered, and the system sends a request to select a court.
2. The system selects the court and sends a request to order food.
3. The court orders the food, and the system sends a notification to prepare the meal.
4. The meal is prepared, and the system notifies the employees.
5. The employees are informed that the meal is ready, and the customer will appear.

In case of a court order:

1. The event 'court order' is triggered, and the system sends a request to hand over the meal.
2. The system prepares the meal and sends a notification to inform the employees.
3. The employees are informed about the prepared meal, and the customer will appear.

The system ensures that the customer's hunger is addressed by selecting a court, ordering food, and preparing the meal. Similarly, when a court order is received, the system ensures that the meal is prepared and notified to the employees, leading to the customer's appearance.
