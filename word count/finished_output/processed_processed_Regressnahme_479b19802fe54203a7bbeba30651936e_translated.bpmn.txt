 In a bustling office environment, a series of tasks and gateways are interconnected to ensure smooth operations. Let's dive into the flow of these processes:

1. A 'Regression possibility\nReport' is generated, triggering the 'Right?' gateway. This report is then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway1', where it is evaluated. If the report indicates a potential regression, the process is directed to 'Process'.

2. Meanwhile, a 'Waiting for VN' event occurs, prompting the 'Right?' gateway to decide the next course of action. If the answer is affirmative, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which forwards the process to 'Process forwarded to collection'. Alternatively, if the answer is negative, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which directs the process to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

3. A 'Set process for resubmission' task is initiated, which is received by the 'Right?' gateway. If the answer is yes, the process is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. If the answer is no, the process is forwarded to 'Process forwarded to collection'.

4. A 'Payment' event is triggered, and the 'Right?' gateway determines the next step. If the answer is yes, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. If the answer is no, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

5. A 'Notification' event is received, and the 'Right?' gateway decides the next action. If the answer is yes, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. If the answer is no, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

6. An 'Inkasso handed over' task is initiated, and the 'Right?' gateway determines the next step. If the answer is yes, the event is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. If the answer is no, the event is sent to 'Process forwarded to collection'.

7. A 'Check regression' task is initiated, and the 'Right?' gateway decides the next action. If the answer is
