 When a scoring request is obtained, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the request and provide a final score. The process begins with the 'Request Obtained' event, which triggers the 'Score Forward' task, sending the score to the bank. If the score is fixed, the 'Score Stand Fixed' task is executed, and the process is closed. In case of a delay, the 'Delay Reported' event leads to the 'Delay Forward' task, which informs the bank about the delay. The 'Score is it?' event at the 'Score is it?' gateway results in a 'Report Delay' task, which also communicates with the bank. The 'EventBasedGateway1' event can lead to either a 'Process Closed' or 'Delay Reported' task, depending on the incoming events. The process concludes with the 'Process Closed' event, which can be triggered by various tasks and gateways, signifying the completion of the scoring request handling.
