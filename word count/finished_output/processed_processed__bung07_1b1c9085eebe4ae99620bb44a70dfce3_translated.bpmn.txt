 In the world of scoring, a series of events and gateways work together to ensure that scoring requests are processed efficiently. Let's dive into the flow of this process:

1. A scoring request is initiated by the event 'Schufascoring\nrequested'. This event triggers the gateway 'EventBasedGateway2', which is responsible for handling incoming requests.

2. The gateway 'EventBasedGateway2' then sends the request to the 'Scoring\nparts' task, which is responsible for obtaining the scoring parts.

3. Once the 'Scoring\nparts' task receives the request, it sends a 'Scoring\nobtained' event to the 'Scoring\nFinished' task, indicating that the scoring parts have been obtained.

4. The 'Scoring\nFinished' task, upon receiving the 'Scoring\nobtained' event, checks if there is a delay. If there is no delay, it sends a 'Scoring\nFinished\n(without delay)\n' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway.

5. If there is a delay, the 'Scoring\nFinished' task sends a 'Scoring\nFinished\n(with delay)' event to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway.

6. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway then decides the final outcome of the scoring process. If there is no delay, it sends a 'Scoring\nFinished\n(without delay)\n' event to the 'Scoring\nFinished' task. If there is a delay, it sends a 'Scoring\nFinished\n(with delay)' event to the 'Scoring\nFinished' task.

7. The 'Scoring\nFinished' task, upon receiving the final outcome, sends the 'Scoring\nFinished' event to the 'End Events' list, marking the completion of the scoring process.

In summary, the scoring process starts with a request, goes through various tasks and gateways, and ends with a final outcome, all while ensuring that the scoring parts are obtained and
