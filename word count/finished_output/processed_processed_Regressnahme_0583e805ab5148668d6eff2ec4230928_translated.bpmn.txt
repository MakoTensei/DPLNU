 The process begins with a 'Possible regression' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request to VN' task. This task has a potential regression, leading to the 'Regression possible?' gateway. If the regression is confirmed, the 'Set process for resubmission' task is initiated, which in turn triggers the 'Opposition obtained from VN' event. This event then leads to the 'Rejection of payment justified?' gateway, which branches into two paths: one leading to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task and the other to the 'Process transferred to debt collection office' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task is triggered by the 'Proceedings' event, which then leads to the 'Process' task. On the other hand, the 'Process transferred to debt collection office' task is triggered by the 'Cash receipt obtained from the VN' event. The 'Cash receipt obtained from the VN' event is triggered by the 'Regression possible?' event at the 'EventBasedGateway3' gateway. The process concludes with the 'Process' task, which has incoming events from both the 'Regression possible?' and 'Regression possible?' gateways.
