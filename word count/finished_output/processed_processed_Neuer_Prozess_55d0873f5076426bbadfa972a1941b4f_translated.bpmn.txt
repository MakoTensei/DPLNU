 When a regression report is received, the process begins with the 'Proceedings' task, which evaluates the report and determines if a refusal is justified. If the report warrants a refusal, the 'Refusal justified?' task is triggered, which can lead to two outcomes: either proceeding to the 'EndEvent2' or initiating the 'Inkasso/Mafia commission' process.

If the refusal is not justified, the 'Possibility' task is activated, which can result in two possible outcomes: either booking a payment request or proceeding to the 'EndEvent1'. If a payment request is made, the 'Get money' task is triggered, which will eventually lead to the 'EndEvent1'.

On the other hand, if the 'Possibility' task leads to the 'EndEvent1', the 'Book money receipt' task is initiated, which will eventually lead to the 'EndEvent2'.

In the case of opposition to the regression report, the 'Opposition' task is triggered, which can lead to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task. This gateway can result in two outcomes: either proceeding to the 'EndEvent2' or initiating the 'Inkasso/Mafia commission' process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Regression report' task, which can lead to various outcomes based on the evaluation of the report. The 'Possibility' task acts as a decision point, leading to different paths depending on whether a refusal is justified or not. The 'EndEvent2' serves as the final outcome for both the refusal and non-refusal paths, while the 'Inkasso/Mafia commission' process is triggered in case of opposition.
