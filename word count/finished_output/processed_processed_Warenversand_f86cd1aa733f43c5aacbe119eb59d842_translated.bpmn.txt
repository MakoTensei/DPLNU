 The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'Requesting quotes' task. This task is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway4', which also connects to 'Separation of shipping' and 'Packaging goods'. The 'Requesting quotes' task leads to the 'Select offers' task, which is initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Select offers' task then connects to 'Specialist', which in turn links to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

The 'Specialist' task is followed by the 'Filling the package note' task, which is triggered by 'InclusiveGateway2'. This task connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which also receives input from 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Filling the package note' task is then followed by the 'Insurance close' task, which is initiated by 'InclusiveGateway2' and leads to 'InclusiveGateway3'.

The 'InclusiveGateway3' task connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which also receives input from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'ParallelGateway5' task then leads to the'sid-549A9909-0676-46D7-AF7E-32F3F656A486' event, which is the end of the process.

Meanwhile, the 'Goods ready for collection' event triggers the 'InclusiveGateway2' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'InclusiveGateway3'. The 'InclusiveGateway3' task then leads to the 'EndEvent0' event, marking the completion of the process.
