 The following tasks and their corresponding gateways are part of a workflow that starts with a 'Shipment' event and ends with an 'EndEvent0' event:

1. The 'Shipment' event triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5' gateways. 'ParallelGateway4' is responsible for handling the 'Quantity\nSet' task, which sets the quantity for the shipment. This task then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway.

2. The 'ParallelGateway5' gateway handles the 'Package tickets\nfilling' task, which involves filling in the necessary details for the shipment. This task connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' gateway processes the 'Package tickets\nfilling' task and forwards it to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway handles the 'Offer 1' and 'Offer 3' tasks, which are related to providing offers for the shipment. These tasks connect to the 'ParallelGateway7' gateway.

5. The 'ParallelGateway7' gateway processes the 'Offer 1' and 'Offer 3' tasks and forwards them to the 'EndEvent0' gateway.

6. The 'EndEvent0' gateway concludes the workflow by handling the 'for collection\nprovide' task, which is triggered by the 'Shipment' event.

In summary, the workflow starts with a 'Shipment' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway5' gateways. The 'Package tickets\nfilling' task is processed by the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateways, while the 'Offer 1' and 'Offer 3' tasks are handled by the 'ParallelGateway7' gateway. Finally, the 'EndEvent0' gateway concludes the workflow by processing the 'for collection\nprovide' task.
