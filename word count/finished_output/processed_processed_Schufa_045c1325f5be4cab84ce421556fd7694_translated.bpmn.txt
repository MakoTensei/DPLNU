 In the process of scoring and fermentation, a series of events and gateways are involved to ensure the proper flow of tasks and results.

The process begins with the 'Scoring\nQuestion\nReport' event, which triggers the 'Scoring request\nsend' task. This task sends the scoring request to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' gateway, which then forwards the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway0' receives the request and forwards it to the 'Result\nLevel 2\nforward' event, which is the end event for the fermentation process.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring\nQuestion\nReport' event also triggers the 'Request\nReport' task. This task sends the report to the 'Results determined?' gateway, which then forwards the results to the 'EndEvent1' event.

The 'Level 2\nScoring\nperform' task is initiated by the'sid-12E38AC2-E47D-461D-8C9A-68238F4402E9' incoming event. This task performs the scoring at level 2 and sends the results to the 'EndEvent1' event.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' gateway receives the 'Scoring request\nsend' task and forwards it to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the request to the 'Result\nLevel 2\nforward' event.

The 'Scoring\nQuestion\nReport' event also triggers the 'Message\nDelay\nforward' task. This task sends a delayed message to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' gateway, which then forwards the message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent6' gateway receives the 'Scoring\nQuestion\nReport' task and forwards it to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the task to the 'EndEvent0' event.

Lastly, the 'Level 2\nS
