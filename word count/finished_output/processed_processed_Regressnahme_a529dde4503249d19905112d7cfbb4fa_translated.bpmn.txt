 When a "Regression case" is received, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure proper handling and resolution. First, the case is checked, and if it's a regression, the "Reimbursement" task is initiated, which sends a payment request. This request is then followed by the "Reimbursement" gateway, which can either close the process or send the money back, depending on the outcome.

If the case is not a regression, the "Close" task is executed, marking the case as resolved. This action also triggers the "Process closed" gateway, which finalizes the case.

In the case of an "Objection," the "Proceedings" task is initiated, and the "Inaksso Service" gateway is triggered, which can either close the process or provide the necessary service, depending on the outcome.

The "Date" event can trigger the "Reimbursement\nExpired" gateway, which sends the money back if the reimbursement has expired. This action also leads to the "Process closed" gateway, finalizing the case.

Overall, the system ensures that each case is handled appropriately, with clear pathways for resolution and closure.
