 Upon receiving dispatched goods, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to ensure proper shipping and collection. First, it checks the quantity of goods to be shipped, then selects the best offer from three carriers. After selecting the offer, the system instructs the ExclusiveGateway0 to process the offer. Concurrently, the system verifies insurance requirements and closes the insurance process through ExclusiveGateway1. Once the goods are packaged, they are sent to ParallelGateway4, which in turn dispatches the goods to ParallelGateway5. Finally, the system prepares the goods for collection and sends them to the collection point.


The process begins with the event 'Goods dispatched they are' which triggers the 'Check quantity to be shipped' task. This task is followed by 'Pick up the offer of 3 carriers' to select the best carrier. The 'Select your offer' task is then executed, which sends a request to ExclusiveGateway0. The '1 instructor' task is initiated to provide instructions to ExclusiveGateway3. The 'need to check insurance' task is processed, leading to the 'Insurance close' task at ExclusiveGateway2. The 'Packaging goods' task is executed, sending the goods to ParallelGateway5. Lastly, the 'Provide goods for collection' task prepares the goods for collection and sends them to the collection point.


Throughout this process, the system communicates with various gateways, including ExclusiveGateway0, ExclusiveGateway1, ExclusiveGateway2, ExclusiveGateway3, and ParallelGateway4 and ParallelGateway5, to ensure a smooth and efficient shipping and collection process.
