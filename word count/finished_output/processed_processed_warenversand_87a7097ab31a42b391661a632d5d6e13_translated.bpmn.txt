 The shipping process begins with a "Shipping requirement" event, which triggers the following sequence of operations:

1. The "Shipping requirement" event initiates the process, with no incoming connections at this stage.

2. The process then moves to the "Insurance required" task, which is triggered by the "Shipping requirement" event. This task has an incoming connection from "Shipping requirement" and an outgoing connection to "Insurance."

6. The "sid-24FFEF15-41BC-4D55-AFE7-CD828D1A42" task has no incoming connections but sends outgoing connections to "ExclusiveGateway4."

7. The "ExclusiveGateway4" task receives incoming connections from "Shipping requirement" and "ExclusiveGateway2." It sends outgoing connections to both "ExclusiveGateway5" and "ExclusiveGateway5."
