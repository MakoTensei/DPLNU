 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the 'Scoring Required' event, which triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task, receiving a 'Scoring request' and sending a 'Scoring Result Available?' message to the 'Scoring Result Available?' gateway. Once the 'Scoring Result Available?' message is received, the 'perform scoring level 2' task is triggered, sending a message to 'Scoring' and receiving a 'Scoring request' to continue the process.

During this process, the 'Delay?' gateway receives a 'Schufa answer' and sends a 'Schufa Information send' message to the 'Schufa Information send' gateway. Additionally, the 'ParallelGateway2' gateway receives a 'Schufa answer' and sends a 'Schufa Information send' message to the 'ParallelGateway3' gateway.

Finally, the 'Schufa Information send' gateway receives a 'Schufa answer' and sends a 'Schufa Information send' message, completing the scoring process.
