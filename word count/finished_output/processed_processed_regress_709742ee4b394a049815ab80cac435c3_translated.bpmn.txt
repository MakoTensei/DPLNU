 In the case of a possible regression, the system initiates a series of tasks and gateways to ensure proper handling and resolution. The process begins with the 'possible regression' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task. This task is directed towards 'Creating a Representation', which in turn leads to 'Refreshment'.

The 'Refreshment' task, upon completion, connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then proceeds to the 'EndEvent1'. Meanwhile, the 'Creating a Representation' task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to 'EndEvent1' as well.

As the 'Refreshment' task is completed, it also connects to 'EventBasedGateway4', which further leads to 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, the 'Check the case' task, which is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway2', also connects to 'EventBasedGateway4', and upon completion, leads to 'EndEvent0'.

Once the 'EndEvent0' is reached, the system proceeds to the 'Book input, close process' task, which is directed towards 'Money received'. This task, upon completion, leads to the final 'EndEvent1'.

In summary, the process of handling a possible regression involves a series of tasks and gateways, including 'Send payment request', 'Creating a Representation', 'Refreshment', 'ExclusiveGateway2', 'EventBasedGateway4', and 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1'. The system ensures that all necessary steps are taken to address the regression and close the case effectively.
