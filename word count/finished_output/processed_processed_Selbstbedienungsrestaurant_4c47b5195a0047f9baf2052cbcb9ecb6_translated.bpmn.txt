 Let's describe the process in a more natural flow:

1. A customer experiences hunger, triggering the "Hunger" event.
2. The system selects the "Eat court" option, leading to the "Court of Justice" event.
3. At the "Court of Justice," the customer places an order, which is then processed by the "Adjust Pieper" event.
4. The "Adjust Pieper" event prepares the meal, and the "Preparation of meal" event is triggered.
5. The customer receives the prepared meal, and the "Trigger Pieper" event is initiated.
6. The "Trigger Pieper" event signals the "Court of Justice" to hand over the meal to the customer.
7. The customer pays for the meal, activating the "paid?" event.
8. If the customer pays, the process ends with the "End" event.
9. If the customer doesn't pay, the "Cash?" event is triggered, leading to the "EndEvent2" event.
5. If the customer picks up the meal, the "Dinner picked up?" event is triggered, leading to the "EndEvent3" and "EndEvent4" events.
10. If the customer's order is put in vain, the "put in vain" event leads to the "EndEvent5" event.

This flow of events ensures a smooth process from hunger to meal consumption, payment, or cancellation.
