 The process begins with the task of shipping goods, which triggers the 'Goods are to be shipped' start event. This leads to the 'Pick up offer at three shipping companies' task, which is assigned to 'ParallelGateway4'. 'ParallelGateway4' then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn leads to the 'Pick up offer at three shipping companies' task.

Once the offers are received, the 'Choose the cheapest offer' task is triggered, which is assigned to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'Insurance\nclose' task.

The 'Insurance\nclose' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which leads to the 'Insurance requirements\nclarification' task. The 'Insurance requirements\nclarification' task connects back to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then leads to 'ParallelGateway5'.

'ParallelGateway5' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'EndEvent0' task. This marks the end of the process.
