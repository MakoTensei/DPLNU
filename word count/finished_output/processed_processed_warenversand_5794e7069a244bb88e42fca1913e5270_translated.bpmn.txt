 In the logistics process, a shipment initiates the workflow, triggering the packaging of goods. This task is assigned to the logistics manager, who must first determine if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, the task is routed to ExclusiveGateway0, which then connects to ExclusiveGateway1. Here, the logistics manager can select a carrier from the three available options.

Once the carrier is chosen, the process continues with the packaging of goods, which is also dependent on the insurance decision. If insurance is not required, the task proceeds directly to ExclusiveGateway1, where the carrier selection takes place.

After the carrier is selected, the goods are shipped, and the process concludes with the goods being shipped. Throughout this process, the insurance requirement is checked at various points, ensuring that the necessary precautions are taken before the goods are shipped.
