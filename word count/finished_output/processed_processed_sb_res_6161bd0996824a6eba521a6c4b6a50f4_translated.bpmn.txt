 A guest enters a restaurant feeling hungry and places an order. The restaurant staff acknowledges the order and guides the guest to a waiting area. After a short wait, the guest is seated and presented with a menu. Once the guest decides on their meal, the order is sent to the kitchen.

While waiting for the food, the guest is served by a server who ensures they are comfortable and informed about the dining experience. The kitchen staff receives the order and prepares the meal, which is then passed to the server for delivery to the guest.

As the guest enjoys their meal, the server checks on their satisfaction and offers any additional requests or assistance. Once the guest finishes eating, the server clears the table and presents the bill. The guest pays for the meal, and the server thanks them for dining at the restaurant.

If the guest does not arrive within a specified time, the restaurant staff initiates a new call to ensure the guest's arrival. Upon the guest's arrival, they are greeted by a Pieper, who introduces themselves and assists the guest with their order.

After the meal, the kitchen staff informs the restaurant employees about the completed order. The guest leaves the restaurant feeling satisfied and satiated, and the staff ensures a smooth and pleasant dining experience.
