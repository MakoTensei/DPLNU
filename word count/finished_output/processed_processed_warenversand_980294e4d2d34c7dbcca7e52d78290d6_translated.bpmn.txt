 The process begins with the 'Shipment to be prepared' event, which triggers the 'Request external offers' task, utilizing the 'ParallelGateway4' as the communication channel. This task is followed by the 'Determine the quantity' task, which also uses 'ParallelGateway4' to receive the necessary information. Concurrently, the 'Insurance close' task is initiated, which sends data to 'ParallelGateway5'. Once the 'Insurance close' task is completed, the 'Filling the package note' task is executed, directing the information to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Goods packaging' task then follows, using 'ParallelGateway5' to send the prepared shipment. Finally, the 'Providing goods' task is triggered, which sends the shipment to the 'Shipment prepared' event, completing the process.

In summary, the process involves the following tasks and gateways:

1. 'Shipment to be prepared' triggers 'Request external offers' and 'Determine the quantity' tasks, both using 'ParallelGateway4'.
2. 'Insurance close' task sends data to 'ParallelGateway5'.
3. 'Filling the package note' task sends information to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. 'Goods packaging' task uses 'ParallelGateway5' to send the prepared shipment.
5. 'Providing goods' task sends the shipment to the 'Shipment prepared' event, completing the process.
