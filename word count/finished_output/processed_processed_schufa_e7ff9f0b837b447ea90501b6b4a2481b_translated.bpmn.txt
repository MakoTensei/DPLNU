 When a scoring event is triggered, the system initiates the 'Pick up scoring' process by pressing a button, which is represented by the ID'sid-260E3049-7A6E-4F98-8E15-2A96C9382F69'. This action leads to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, identified by'sid-FF1C0A0D-3AF9-4F04-B4D6-E8159161A27C', which then sends a 'Scoring request' to the system, as denoted by'sid-96E0D8CF-DD84-45CD-B522-A011B68156A7'.

Simultaneously, another 'Scoring request' is sent to initiate 'Level 2 Scoring', represented by'sid-DA0E5F33-1092-4889-88F7-6F2C54D36C57'. Both 'Level 1 Scoring' and 'Level 2 Scoring' tasks are connected to the 'EventBasedGateway0' with the ID'sid-E8C7C699-7B77-480B-941C-96EAD6DE5F2E', which waits for incoming events.

After the scoring tasks are completed, the 'EventBasedGateway0' sends a 'Report result to Frontend' event, identified by'sid-68A3C5FD-98CA-47EE-A09F-A5F4873B20B9', which triggers the 'Return result' event for both 'Level 1 Scoring' and 'Level 2 Scoring', represented by'sid-E3FF157B-9C8A-4B1C-886C-DFAA25C9B132' and'sid-1C2A4A66-106E-49B6-B758-1868C2DDF
