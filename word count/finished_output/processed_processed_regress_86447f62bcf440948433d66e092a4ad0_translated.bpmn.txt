 In the event of a possible regression against VN, the following sequence of tasks and gateways are triggered:

1. The 'possible regression against VN' event initiates the 'Check regression' task, which sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
2. If the 'Check regression' task finds a regression, it triggers the 'Send payment request to VN' task, which sends a message to 'ParallelGateway4'.
3. Concurrently, the 'possible regression against VN' event also triggers the 'Verify your objection' task, which sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. If the 'Verify your objection' task finds an objection, it triggers the 'forward case to debt collection service providers' task, which sends a message to 'Process delivered to debt collection service provider'.
5. If the 'Check regression' task finds no regression, the 'Book the entrance' task is triggered, which sends a message to 'EndEvent0'.
6. If the 'Send payment request to VN' task finds no regression, the 'Book the entrance' task is triggered, which sends a message to 'EndEvent0'.
7. If the 'Verify your objection' task finds no objection, the 'Book the entrance' task is triggered, which sends a message to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the 'possible regression against VN' event can lead to different outcomes based on the results of the 'Check regression' and 'Verify your objection' tasks. The 'Book the entrance' task is always triggered, and the 'EndEvent0' is always the final event.
