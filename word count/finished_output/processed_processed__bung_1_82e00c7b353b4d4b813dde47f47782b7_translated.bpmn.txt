 The process begins with the 'Goods to be shipped they are' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers (three carriers)' task. This task is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway4', which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then leads to the 'Select your offer' task, which is followed by the 'Appoint forwarding' task, also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Fill out standard package tickets' task is initiated through 'ExclusiveGateway0', leading to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Required?' event, also coming from 'ExclusiveGateway0', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' as well.

The 'Appoint forwarding' task, originating from 'ExclusiveGateway0', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'Required?' event, also from 'ExclusiveGateway0', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
