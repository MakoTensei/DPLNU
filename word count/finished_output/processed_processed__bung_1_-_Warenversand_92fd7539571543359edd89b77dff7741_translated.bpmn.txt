 Let's walk through the process of handling the shipment of goods, from the initial request to the final delivery:

1. The process begins with the event 'Goods be sent' (sid-07DB13A3-0448-4EF2-BC6E-24D63E2507C5). This event triggers the 'Request a quote' task (sid-2A52F8D0-0A4E-4DE0-8C3C-0E2E8F055274), which is routed through the 'ParallelGateway6' (sid-sid-2A52F8D0-0A4E-4DE0-8C3C-0E2E8F055274).

2. The 'Request a quote' task then leads to the 'Special offer Spediteur 1 the' task (sid-815F4C31-5C59-439B-859D-F1E155B5954F), which is routed through 'ParallelGateway5' (sid-sid-815F4C31-5C59-439B-859D-F1E155B5954F).

3. The 'Special offer Spediteur 1 the' task connects to the 'Select the Spediteur' task (sid-94B8D0BB-75C7-41D5-8A28-8C339B318581), which is routed through 'ParallelGateway6' (sid-sid-94B8D0BB-75C7-41D5-8A28-8C339B318581).

4. The 'Select the Spediteur' task then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' task (sid-A469533E-BB88-4B91-8738-056FE16905
