 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway then leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Insurance close' task, which also originates from 'ParallelGateway4', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Lot?' gateway, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4', directs to '3 offers' and 'Select your offer'. The 'Select your offer' task then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway4' also leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, which connects to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Goods ready for collection' task, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway5', connects to 'EndEvent0'.

Lastly, the 'Insurance close' task, which also receives input from 'ParallelGateway4', connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'EndEvent0'. This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures a smooth flow of operations from the start to the end of the shipping process.
