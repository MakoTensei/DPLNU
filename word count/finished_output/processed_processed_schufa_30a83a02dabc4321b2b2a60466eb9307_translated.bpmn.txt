 When a Schufa request is triggered, the system initiates a sequence of tasks and interactions between various components to determine the customer's credit score. The process begins with the 'Schufa request\ntriggered' event, which sends a request to Schufa for a credit score inquiry. This event then leads to the 'Scoring View result' task, which generates a report on the customer's credit score.

Simultaneously, the system also initiates a delay to ensure that the scoring process is completed accurately. This delay is managed by the 'Delay display' task, which is executed in parallel with the 'Scoring View result' task.

The system then determines the customer's credit score level by evaluating the request report. This task is divided into two parallel gateways: 'Determine Schufa Score Level 1' and 'Determine Schufa Score Level 2'. Each gateway sends the request report to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then directs the request to the appropriate scoring task based on the score level.

Once the score level is determined, the system sends the report to the 'Schufascore\nReport' task, which generates a final report on the customer's credit score. This report is then sent to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the scoring process.

In parallel, the 'Delay display' task sends the request report to the 'ParallelGateway2', which directs the request to the 'EndEvent3' and 'Back to Schufa Score' tasks. The 'EndEvent3' task completes the delay process, while the 'Back to Schufa Score' task sends the customer back to the Schufa system for further actions.

Overall, the system ensures a seamless and efficient process for determining the customer's credit score by utilizing various tasks and gateways to handle the request, delay, and scoring process.
