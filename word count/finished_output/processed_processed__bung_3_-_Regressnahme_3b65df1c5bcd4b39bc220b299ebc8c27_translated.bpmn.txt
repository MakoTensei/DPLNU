 In the case of a regression possibility before a payment request, the system initiates a 'Case Check' process, which is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If the case is deemed justified, the system proceeds to reject the request and sets up a rejection process. Concurrently, an 'Opposition Check' is triggered due to a contradiction from the Vendor Number (VN), also leading to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.


Meanwhile, the 'Payment on request' task is set in motion, sending a message to the debtor. If the 'Regression case' is confirmed, the system routes the payment request to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. However, if the rejection process is established, the system sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3' for further action.


As the payment request is processed, a 'Payment Book' event is triggered, which is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway2'. If the rejection process is in place, the system sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.


Upon successful processing of the payment request, the system closes the 'Process Debtor Delivered' task, which is triggered by the 'Regression possible?' event.


Simultaneously, the 'Process Closed' task is initiated, which is triggered by the 'Payment Book' event. This task concludes the entire sequence of events, marking the end of the process.
