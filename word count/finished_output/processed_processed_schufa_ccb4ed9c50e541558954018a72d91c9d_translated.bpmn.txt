 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the 'Scoring\nRequired' start event, which triggers the 'Intermediate award at Frontend' task. This task is responsible for requesting the scoring process. Once the scoring process is initiated, the 'StartEvent1' event kicks off the 'Interim score to Bank' task, which sends the interim score to the bank.

The 'Level 1 Scoring' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', sends the score to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Level 2 Scoring' task, also triggered by 'StartEvent1', sends the score to the 'Scoring successful?' gateways. If the score is successful, the 'Scoring ends' task is triggered, and the 'EndEvent0' task is executed.

The 'Interim results' task, triggered by 'Scoring\nRequired', sends the interim results to the 'EndEvent0' task. The 'Result to Bank' task, triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway1', sends the final score to the bank.

In summary, the scoring process starts with the 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which triggers the 'Intermediate award at Frontend' task. The 'StartEvent1' event initiates the 'Interim score to Bank' and 'Level 1 Scoring' tasks, which send the score to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Level 2 Scoring' task sends the score to the 'Scoring successful?' gateways, and if successful, the 'Scoring ends' task is triggered, leading to the 'EndEvent0' task. The 'Interim results' task sends the interim results to the 'EndEvent0' task, and the 'Result to Bank' task sends the final score to the bank.
