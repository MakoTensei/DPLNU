 In the order fulfillment process, the system starts with the 'Start\nVersatile order' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the 'Explain the shipping method' task is initiated, which requires information from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, the 'Filling the package note' task is activated, also receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4' and directing its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Pick up offers' task is then triggered, which requires input from 'Lot?' and sends its output to 'Select your offer'. This task is followed by the 'Select your offer' task, which also requires input from 'Lot?' and sends its output to 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' task then sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If insurance is necessary, the 'Insurance close' task is activated, which requires input from 'Insurance necessary?' and sends its output to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'Packaging goods' task is initiated, which requires input from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends its output to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Finally, the 'Provide for collection' task is triggered, which requires input from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends its output to 'EndEvent0'. This marks the completion of the order fulfillment process.
