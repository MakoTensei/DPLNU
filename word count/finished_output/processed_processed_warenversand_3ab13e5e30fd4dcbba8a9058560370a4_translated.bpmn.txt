 In the shipping process, there are several tasks and gateways involved. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which checks if a special shipment is necessary. If it is, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Special Delivery' task is initiated. This task involves picking up offers and selecting them. If a special shipment is not necessary, the process moves to 'ParallelGateway5' where the 'Normal Shipping' task is initiated. This task involves filling in the parking certificate.

The 'Normal Shipping' task then moves to 'Pick up offers & select' which checks if a special shipment is necessary again. If it is, the process moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Package shipping' task is initiated. If it is not, the process moves to 'ParallelGateway5' where the 'Ship' task is initiated.

The 'Ship' task then moves to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Package shipping' task is completed.

In summary, the shipping process starts with a check for a special shipment. If it is necessary, a special delivery is initiated. If not, a normal shipping process is initiated. Both processes involve filling in a parking certificate and selecting offers. The special delivery process also involves insuring the shipment. The final step in both processes is to ship the package.
