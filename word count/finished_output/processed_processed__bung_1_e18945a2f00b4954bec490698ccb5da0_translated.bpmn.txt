 The process begins with the task of packaging goods, which is triggered by the event "Goods be sent." This task receives input from ParallelGateway5 and outputs "Supplying goods for shipping." The goods are then supplied for shipping, which is initiated by the incoming event "Goods be sent."

Once the goods are supplied for shipping, the process moves to the next task, which is to determine the size of the shipping. This task receives input from ParallelGateway5 and outputs to ExclusiveGateway1 and Insurance necessary? gateways. The size of the shipping is then used to determine the insurance requirements, which is triggered by the event "Determining insurance requirements." This task receives input from the size of shipping and outputs to ParallelGateway4.

ParallelGateway4 then sends the goods pickup ready event, which is triggered by the task "Pick up offers for freight forwarders." This event receives input from ParallelGateway5 and outputs "Goods Pickup Ready."

Finally, the process ends with the event "Goods Pickup Ready," which receives input from the task "Supplying goods for shipping" and outputs nothing. This signifies the completion of the process.
