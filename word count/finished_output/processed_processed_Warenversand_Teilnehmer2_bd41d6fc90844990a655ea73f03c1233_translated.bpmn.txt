 The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the incoming 'Goods ready for dispatch' and directs the flow to 'Package tickets and filling'. Concurrently, 'Pick up offers' event also triggers 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the incoming 'Big crowd?' and directs the flow to 'Package tickets and filling'. 

Once the 'Package tickets and filling' event is completed, the flow proceeds to 'Provide packaged goods for collection' event, which is triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway2' handling the incoming 'ParallelGateway4'. This event then sends the flow to 'ParallelGateway3' for the next step.

Meanwhile, the 'Insurance necessary?' event also triggers 'ExclusiveGateway2' to handle the incoming 'Insurance necessary?' and directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway3'. 

The 'ParallelGateway3' then handles the incoming 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway4' and sends the flow to 'Goods for collection\nready' event. This event signifies the completion of the process, with the flow returning to the start.
