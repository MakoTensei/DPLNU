 In the scoring process, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the'send scoring request' task, which then forwards the request to the 'forward scoring result' gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends the result to the'scoring result on frontend' task, which concludes with the 'End' event. Meanwhile, the'report delay' task, triggered by'sid-76E8DB45-F066-49F9-BF3F-F17BD0D4D3C3', sends an intermediate event to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent0' gateway. This gateway then sends the event to the 'level1-scoring' task, which generates a'result report' that is sent to the'result report' task, concluding with the 'End' event. The 'level2-scoring' task, triggered by'sid-54D33369-8DBE-4BA2-97CE-1B4692819B5E', also generates a'result report' that is sent to the'result report\n' task, ending with the 'End' event.
