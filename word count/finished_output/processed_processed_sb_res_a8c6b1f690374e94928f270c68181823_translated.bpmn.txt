 A guest experiences hunger, prompting them to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they browse the menu and select their desired dishes. The restaurant then prepares the meal, which is served to the guest. After enjoying their food, the guest collects it and leaves the restaurant. The restaurant's cashier processes the order, and the guest exits the establishment, receiving a Pieper as a token of appreciation. The entire process is managed through a series of events and gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient dining experience.
