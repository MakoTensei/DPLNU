 In a bustling warehouse, a series of tasks are carried out to ensure the smooth delivery of goods. The process begins with a 'Shipment required' event, triggering the 'Packaging goods' task, which is facilitated by the 'ParallelGateway5'. Once the goods are packaged, the 'Delivering goods' task is initiated, also through 'ParallelGateway5'.

Simultaneously, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered by the 'Insurance necessary?' event, which is directed to 'ParallelGateway5'. The insurance process is completed, and the 'Shipment prepared' event is generated, which is then handled by 'ParallelGateway5'.

As the shipment is prepared, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is followed by the 'Clearing insurance requirements' task, which is also linked to 'ParallelGateway4'.

The 'Insurance necessary?' event is then directed to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn connects to 'ParallelGateway5'. This ensures that the insurance process is completed before the shipment is prepared.

Finally, the 'Shipment prepared' event is generated, which is handled by 'ParallelGateway5'. This marks the end of the process, with the goods successfully packaged, insured, and ready for delivery.
