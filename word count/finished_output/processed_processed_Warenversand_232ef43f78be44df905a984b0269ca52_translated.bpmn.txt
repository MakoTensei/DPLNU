 The process begins with the "StartEvent0" triggering the "Pick up offers" task, which connects to the "ParallelGateway5". This gateway leads to the "Complete insurance" task, which in turn connects to the "ExclusiveGateway2".

Next, the "StartEvent1" initiates the "Check and compare offers" task, which connects to the "Select the Spediteur" task. This task is linked to the "ExclusiveGateway4", which then connects to the "Spediteur cancel" task.

The "Spediteur cancel" task has no outgoing connections, indicating that it's the end of this process.

The "StartEvent2" triggers the "Send a message" task, which connects to the "ExclusiveGateway3". This gateway leads to the "EndEvent0" and "EndEvent1" tasks, marking the completion of these processes.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. "StartEvent0" -> "Pick up offers" -> "ParallelGateway5" -> "Complete insurance" -> "ExclusiveGateway2"
2. "StartEvent1" -> "Check and compare offers" -> "Select the Spediteur" -> "ExclusiveGateway4" -> "Spediteur cancel"
3. "StartEvent2" -> "Send a message" -> "ExclusiveGateway3" -> "EndEvent0" and "EndEvent1"
