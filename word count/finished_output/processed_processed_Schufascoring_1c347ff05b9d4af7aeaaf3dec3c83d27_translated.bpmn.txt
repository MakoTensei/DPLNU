 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Prepare customer data' task, which then sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring request' task. This task, in turn, sends an 'EndEvent0' signal. The 'Scoring request' task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, which routes the task to the 'Scoring (level 1)' task. This task generates a 'Generate delay message' and sends it to the 'Generate delay message' task, which then sends an 'EndEvent1' signal. The 'Scoring (level 1)' task is also connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateway, which routes it to the 'Scoring (level 2)' task. This task generates an 'EndEvent1' signal, which is received by the 'Result?' gateway. The 'Result?' gateway then sends an 'EndEvent1' signal, completing the process.
