 In the event of a scoring request, the process begins at the StartEvent0, which triggers the EventBasedGateway0. This gateway then sends a Delay signal, leading to the Scoring Level 1 task. The Scoring Level 1 task, upon completion, sends a Delay signal to EventBasedGateway1, which in turn triggers the Scoring Level 2 task. The Scoring Level 2 task, upon completion, sends an EndEvent1 signal, marking the end of the process.
