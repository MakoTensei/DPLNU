 When a scoring request is obtained, the process begins with the 'Scoring request obtained' start event, which triggers the 'perform scoring request' task with the unique identifier'sid-B601A2D5-7121-4229-8B1E-70216453809F'. This task initiates the Level 1 Scoring process, which is represented by the 'Level 1 Scoring' task with the identifier'sid-5FF9A1E0-4F95-4C9B-A67D-2990D31C873F'. Upon completion, the Level 1 Scoring task sends a 'Result?' message to the 'Result?' gateway, which in turn triggers the 'Bank feedback' task with the identifier'sid-CF603182-096D-4B2F-8CE7-7831AFB02C32'. This task concludes with an 'EndEvent1' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Result?' message from the Level 1 Scoring task also reaches the 'Result?' gateway, which then sends a 'Result?' message to the 'Level 2 Scoring' task with the identifier'sid-AD35326C-D768-4DE0-BD1A-A4095EA39A53'. The Level 2 Scoring task concludes with a 'Bank feedback' task, which triggers the 'EndEvent2' event with the identifier'sid-BBFB375D-13B8-4D58-AAB5-84F55A4014CB'.

In summary, the scoring request process involves the 'perform scoring request' task, the 'Level 1 Scoring' and 'Level 2 Scoring' tasks, and the 'Bank feedback' tasks, all coordinated through the 'Result?' gateway and ending with the 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', and 'EndEvent2' events.
