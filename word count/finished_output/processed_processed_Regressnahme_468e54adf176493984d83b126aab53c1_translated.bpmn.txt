 In a complex workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check the case' task, leading to the 'ParallelGateway3'. From there, the 'Check the case' task proceeds to the 'ParallelGateway4', which then forwards the case to the 'forward to the debt collection institution' task. Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway3' also sends the case to the 'Reimbursement' task. The 'Reimbursement' task, in turn, connects to the 'ParallelGateway4', which ultimately leads to the 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway3' also sends the case to the 'Book incoming payment' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent0'. The 'Book incoming payment' task is initiated by the 'StartEvent0' and is also linked to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. The 'EndEvent0' is the final step in this process, receiving input from 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
