 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Offers from 3 carriers\nenroll' task. This task is responsible for enrolling suitable forwarders from three carriers. Once the suitable forwarders are selected, the'select suitable forwarders' task is triggered. The selected forwarders are then passed to the 'Specialist' task, which is responsible for handling the special shipment. The 'Specialist' task then passes the special shipment to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Offers from 3 carriers\nenroll' task also triggers the 'Preparing mail' task, which prepares the mail for the special shipment. The 'Preparing mail' task then passes the mail to the 'InclusiveGateway2' task.

The 'Specialist' task also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which fills the package note for the special shipment. The 'Filling the package note' task then passes the package note to the 'ParallelGateway5' task.

The 'ParallelGateway4' task, which is triggered by the 'StartEvent0', enrolls the three carriers and passes the offers to the 'ParallelGateway5' task. The 'ParallelGateway5' task then triggers the 'Delivering goods' task, which delivers the goods.
