 The process begins with the 'Starts scoring' event, which triggers the 'Determine Schufascore' task. This task then sends an intermediate event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which in turn leads to the 'Positive result obtained' task. This task concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' event initiates the 'Scoring Level 1' task, which sends a result to 'Send result to BAnk'. This task also triggers the 'Scoring is fixed?' event, which leads to two possible outcomes: 'Send result to credit award' and 'a few minutes'. The 'Send result to credit award' task concludes with 'EndEvent0', while 'a few minutes' leads to 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Scoring Level 1' task also sends an intermediate event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', which concludes with 'EndEvent0'.

After a few minutes, the 'a few minutes' event triggers the 'Send final result to Bank' task, which concludes with 'EndEvent1'.

In summary, the process starts with scoring, determines the Schufascore, and then sends the result to the bank. The scoring process can be fixed, leading to different outcomes. The process concludes with the final result being sent to the bank.
