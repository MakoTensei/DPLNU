 In the process of handling a financial transaction, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Send a message' task, setting the process for resubmission. This task is then directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which subsequently leads to the 'Check regression' task. If the 'Check regression' task is successful, the process moves to the 'Justified?' task, which is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway5'. Depending on the outcome, the process either proceeds to the 'Proceedings' task or moves to the 'Opposition' task.

If the 'Opposition' task is triggered, the system then moves to the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which is directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task is followed by the 'Transfer of debtors' task, which is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway5'.

On the other hand, if the 'Proceedings' task is triggered, the process moves to the 'Book money receipt' task, which is directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task is followed by the 'EndEvent0' task, marking the completion of the process.

In summary, the system handles a financial transaction by initiating with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers a series of tasks and gateways, ultimately leading to the 'EndEvent0'. The process involves checking for regression, handling opposition, setting the process for resubmission, transferring debtors, and booking money receipts.
