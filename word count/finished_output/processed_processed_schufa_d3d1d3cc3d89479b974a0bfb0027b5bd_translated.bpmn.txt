 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Schufa Scoring' task, leading to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event then connects to the 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Level 1 Score' task, which concludes with 'EndEvent1'. The 'Level 1 Score' task further triggers the 'Level 2 Score' task, which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then leads to the 'EndEvent1'. The 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Level 1 Score' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' tasks, which both end with 'EndEvent1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' is triggered by 'StartEvent1' and concludes with 'EndEvent1'. Lastly, 'ExclusiveGateway0' is triggered by 'StartEvent0' and leads to 'EndEvent0'.
