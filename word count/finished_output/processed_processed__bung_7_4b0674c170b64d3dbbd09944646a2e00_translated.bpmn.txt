 In a financial services application, various tasks and events are interconnected to handle requests and feedback related to credit scoring and banking operations. Here's a natural flow description of the system using the provided names:

When a Schufa request is received, it triggers an event that sends a Schufa inquiry to the credit bureau. This event is handled by the EventBasedGateway1, which processes the inquiry and sends a Scoring 2 to the bank.

Upon receiving the Schufa request, the system also reports a delay, which is processed by the Delay occurred? gateway. This gateway then creates a Scoring 2 and sends it to the bank.

If the Schufa request results in a delay, the system reports the delay, which is processed by the Delay occurred? gateway. This gateway then creates a Scoring 2 and sends it to the bank.

The bank receives the request and processes it, sending the result back to the system. This event is handled by the Get Schufa result gateway, which sends the result to the Frontend for feedback.

The system also sends feedback to the Frontend regarding the Schufa result, which is processed by the Send feedback to Frontend gateway.

If the Schufa request results in a delay, the system sends feedback to the Frontend, which is processed by the Send feedback (delay) gateway.

When a delay occurs, the system reports it, which is processed by the Delay occurred? gateway. This gateway then creates a Scoring 2 and sends it to the bank.

The system also creates a scoring level 1 when a request is received, which is processed by the Creating scoring (level 1) gateway.

If a delay occurs, the system creates a Scoring 2, which is sent to the bank through the Create scoring 2 to Bank gateway.

Finally, the system sends the Scoring 2 to the bank, which is processed by the Send Scoring 2 to Bank gateway.

In summary, the system handles Schufa requests, delays, and credit scoring operations through a series of interconnected tasks and events, ensuring efficient processing and communication between the system, credit bureau, and bank.
