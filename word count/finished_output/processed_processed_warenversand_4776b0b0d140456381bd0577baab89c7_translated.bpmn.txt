 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Special delivery' gateway. This gateway then sends the package to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Special delivery' gateway also sends the package to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'Filling the package note' tasks.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the package note and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway4' receives the 'ParallelGateway6' and sends it to the 'ParallelGateway5' and 'Request offer 2'. The 'ParallelGateway5' receives the 'StartEvent0', 'ParallelGateway6', and 'ParallelGateway4' and sends the package to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Select your offer' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway6' and sends the offer to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ParallelGateway7' receives the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'ParallelGateway6' and sends the package to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'EndEvent0' receives the package from the 'ParallelGateway7' and completes the process.
