 The process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' event, where the goods are ready to be shipped. The goods are then received by 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for handling large quantities. From 'ParallelGateway6', the goods are sent to 'ParallelGateway7' for further processing. Concurrently, the 'InclusiveGateway4' receives the 'Goods for shipping' and sends it to 'InclusiveGateway5' and 'InclusiveGateway5' for further processing.

Meanwhile, 'Pick up offers' task is triggered, which involves picking up offers and assigning them to 'Spediteur'. The offers are received by 'large quantity' and are then assigned to 'Spediteur'.

The 'Spediteur assignment' task is initiated, where the 'large quantity' is assigned to 'Spediteur'. The 'Spediteur' then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'Packaging goods' task is also initiated, where the goods are packaged and sent to 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'Insurance close' task is triggered, where the goods are insured and sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Finally, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, where the package note is filled and sent to 'InclusiveGateway5'. The 'InclusiveGateway5' then sends the package note to 'ParallelGateway7'.

In summary, the process involves the coordination of various tasks and gateways to ensure the smooth handling and shipping of goods, from picking up offers to filling package notes.
