 In the logistics process, various tasks and gateways are involved in handling the shipment of goods. Here's a natural flow description of the system:

1. The process begins with the 'Goods to be sent' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to handle the incoming goods.
2. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then routes the goods to either 'ParallelGateway6' or 'Complete insurance' based on the 'Insurance required?' event.
3. If insurance is required, the goods are sent to 'EndEvent0'. If not, they proceed to 'ParallelGateway6'.
4. At 'ParallelGateway6', the goods are further routed to 'ExclusiveGateway4' or 'ParallelGateway7' based on the 'Special shipment?' event.
5. The 'ExclusiveGateway4' handles the selected special offer and routes the goods to 'ParallelGateway7'.
6. 'ParallelGateway7' then takes over, and the goods are prepared for collection.
7. The 'Provide goods for collection' event triggers the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the process.

Additionally, there are other gateways and tasks involved in the process:

- 'Special shipment?' event routes to 'ExclusiveGateway4' or 'Standard package filling' based on the incoming goods.
- 'What Special offer selected?' event routes to 'ExclusiveGateway4' three times, handling the selection of special offers.
- 'Complete insurance' event routes to 'EndEvent0' or 'ParallelGateway7' based on the incoming goods.
- 'Spediteur 1 commission' and 'Spediteur 2' tasks handle the commission for selected special offers and route to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
- 'Packaging goods' task prepares the goods for shipment and routes to 'ParallelGateway7'.

This flow ensures that the shipment of goods is managed efficiently, with each task and gateway playing a crucial role in the process.
