 Upon receiving a scoring request, the system initiates a sequence of events to process the request and provide the necessary information to the bank. Here's a flow of the process:

1. The system receives a scoring request and sends it to the ExclusiveGateway0.
2. The ExclusiveGateway0 evaluates the request and determines that the scoring process is required. It sends the request to the 'Scoring Level 1' task, which then sends customer information to the 'Customer information' task.
3. The 'Scoring Level 1' task receives the scoring result and sends it to the 'Scoring Result Level 1?' task.
4. The 'Scoring Result Level 1?' task evaluates the result and determines that the scoring process is successful. It sends the result to the 'Send result to Bank' task.
5. The 'Send result to Bank' task sends the result to the 'Bank information' task, which then sends the result to the 'Scoring Level 2 successful?' task.
6. The 'Scoring Level 2 successful?' task evaluates the result and determines that the scoring process is not possible. It sends the result to the 'No scoring possible' task.
7. The 'No scoring possible' task sends the result to the 'Info to Bank' task.
8. The 'Info to Bank' task sends the result to the 'EndEvent3' task, which marks the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with a scoring request, which goes through a series of tasks to determine the outcome and communicate the result to the bank.
