 When goods are sent, the process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Filling the package note' task. The 'Filling the package note' task requires confirmation if a special shipment is necessary, which is handled by the 'Special shipment necessary?' gateway. If the special shipment is necessary, the process continues to 'Appoint forwarding' task, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Once the goods are confirmed to be shipped, the 'Pick up offers' task connects to the 'Select your offer' task, which also requires confirmation if a special shipment is necessary. If the special shipment is necessary, the process moves to 'Appoint forwarding' task, which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

After the goods are shipped and the offer is selected, the 'Appoint forwarding' task leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to the 'Complete insurance' task. This task requires confirmation if insurance is necessary, which is handled by the 'Is an insurance necessary?' gateway. If insurance is necessary, the process moves to the 'Complete insurance' task, which leads to the 'Goods delivered' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task connects to the 'Select your offer' task, which requires confirmation if a special shipment is necessary. If the special shipment is necessary, the process moves to 'Appoint forwarding' task, which connects to the 'Complete insurance' task.
