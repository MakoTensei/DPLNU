 When a regression is reported, the system initiates a process to check the case, which involves an exclusive gateway. If the case is justified, the process moves to close the case and end the event. If the case is not justified, the process proceeds to the proceedings, which involves another exclusive gateway. During the proceedings, if the payment is not received, the system books the entrance and ends the event. Additionally, if the payment is received, the system sets the process for resubmission and sends the case to the exclusive gateway.

In the case of a denial of payment being justified, the system informs the collection service providers and ends the event. If the payment is not justified, the system proceeds to the proceedings and ends the event.

When the reimbursement period expires, the system ends the event.

The system starts the process with the start event and ends the process with the end event.
