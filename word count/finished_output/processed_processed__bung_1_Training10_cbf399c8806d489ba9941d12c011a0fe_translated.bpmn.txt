 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' task, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to decide whether the goods are big or small. Depending on the decision, the goods are either sent to 'Packaging goods' or 'Provide packaged goods for collection'. If the goods are small, they are sent to 'Packaging goods', which then sends them to 'EndEvent0'. On the other hand, if the goods are big, they are sent to 'Provide packaged goods for collection', which also leads to 'EndEvent0'.

In parallel, the 'Separation Shipping' task sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then sends the goods to 'Provide packaged goods for collection' and 'EndEvent0'.

Meanwhile, the 'Complete insurance' task, triggered by 'ParallelGateway5', sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then sends the goods to 'InclusiveGateway4'.

The 'Filling the package note' task, also triggered by 'ParallelGateway5', sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then sends the goods to 'InclusiveGateway4'.

Lastly, the 'Pick up offers' task, triggered by 'Big or small?', sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway then sends the goods to 'Packaging goods'.

In summary, the process involves several tasks and gateways working together to ensure the goods are properly packaged, insured, and shipped. The 'EndEvent0' marks the completion of the process.
