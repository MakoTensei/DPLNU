 In the scoring system, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process scoring requests and determine if the results are sufficient.

1. When a scoring request and report arrive, the 'Scoring request\nReport' task is triggered. This task is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then forwards the request to'sid-86E4F368-AB7F-4D59-8249-8E5D1C6CBAA0'.

2. If the result is not sufficient, the task 'Check if delay' is initiated. This task is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which checks for any delay and forwards the request to'sid-58D136D0-2C67-4EF1-B0A3-79A559FE5FED'.

3. If the result is sufficient, the task 'Return Score' is triggered. This task is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then sends the score to'sid-D2F38CBE-78D2-407E-9064-DAB9D5C1763E' and 'Check if delay'.

4. The 'Check if delay' task is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which checks for any delay and forwards the request to'sid-58D136D0-2C67-4EF1-B0A3-79A559FE5FED'.

5. The 'Level 1 Score' task is triggered when a scoring request and report arrive. This task is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then sends the score to'sid-D2F38CBE-78D2-407E-9064-DAB9D5C1763E' and 'Check if delay'.

6. The 'Check if delay' task is sent to 'ExclusiveGateway4', which checks for any delay and forwards the request to'sid-58D136D0-2C67-4EF1
