 The process begins with the 'Requirements' event, which triggers a 'Delay' event. This delay is then followed by the 'Scoring request' event, which initiates the creation of 'L1' and 'L2'. The 'L1' creation leads to the 'L1 delivers Result' event, which in turn sends 'L1 to Bank' and 'L1 scoring at the front end' events. Similarly, the 'L2' creation results in the 'Result L2' event, which then triggers 'L2 scoring at the front end' and 'L2 to Bank' events. This flow ensures that the scoring request is processed, results are delivered, and the necessary bank transactions are initiated.
