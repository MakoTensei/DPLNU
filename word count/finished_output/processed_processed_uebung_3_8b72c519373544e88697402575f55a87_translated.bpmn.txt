 The workflow begins with the 'Regression report' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request to VN' task. This task is dependent on the 'Regression report' and leads to the 'Set status on "Republish"' task. The 'Set status on "Republish"' task, in turn, triggers the 'Objection' task, which is dependent on it and results in the 'Case closed' task.

Simultaneously, the 'Regression report' event also triggers the 'Date of expiry' task, which is dependent on the 'Regress possible?' gateway. The 'Date of expiry' task then leads to the 'Close the case' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Payment received' event triggers the 'Close the case' task, which is dependent on it and results in the 'Payment booked' task. The 'Payment booked' task is dependent on the 'EventBasedGateway3' and leads to the 'EndEvent1' task.

In summary, the workflow involves the following tasks and events:

1. 'Regression report' event triggers 'Send payment request to VN' task.
2. 'Send payment request to VN' task triggers 'Set status on "Republish"' task.
3. 'Set status on "Republish"' task triggers 'Objection' task.
4. 'Regression report' event triggers 'Date of expiry' task.
5. 'Date of expiry' task triggers 'Close the case' task.
6. 'Payment received' event triggers 'Close the case' task.
7. 'Close the case' task triggers 'Payment booked' task.
8. 'Payment booked' task triggers 'EndEvent1' task.

The 'Case closed' task can be triggered by either the 'Objection' task or the 'Close the case' task, depending on the specific circumstances.
