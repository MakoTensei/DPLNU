 In the process of handling a financial transaction, a Regression report is initiated, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The Regression report leads to a VN payment request, which in turn requires a Procedure for resubmission due to a potential regression. This Procedure for resubmission results in a Max. WV time of 1 week, which is then followed by a Cash receipt from the VN. The Cash receipt from the VN prompts a Complete the process, and finally, the process is completed.


Meanwhile, an Opposition event occurs, which is justified through the Process Reimbursement gateway. This Opposition event leads to an ExclusiveGateway2 and subsequently to an Inkasso-DL Mission.


The ExclusiveGateway3 is a critical point in the process, handling various incoming events such as Regression possible, Examination of the Regress Report, and Opposition. It directs these events to either a Process Completion or an Inkasso-DL Mission, depending on the specific circumstances.


The ExclusiveGateway2 is another crucial gateway, receiving the Process Reimbursement and Proceedings events, and directing them to the Inkasso-DL Mission.


The process begins with the Regression report, which sets off a chain of events and interactions between tasks, gateways, and end events, ultimately leading to the completion of the process or the initiation of an Inkasso-DL Mission.
