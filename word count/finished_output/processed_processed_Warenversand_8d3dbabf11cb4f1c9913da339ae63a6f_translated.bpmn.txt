 When a new product is sent, it triggers the 'Pick up offers' task, which then connects to 'ParallelGateway3'. This gateway leads to 'Select your offer', which in turn connects to 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which further leads to 'Filling the package note'. If insurance is necessary, it connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' as well. After the package is filled, it goes through 'ExclusiveGateway2' and finally reaches 'Goods are collected' through 'ParallelGateway4'. If a big crowd is expected, the process starts at 'New product\nbe sent', leading to 'Big crowd?' at 'ParallelGateway3', which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and then to 'Goods are collected' through 'ParallelGateway4'.
