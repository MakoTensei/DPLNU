 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the pickup of 'Schufascroing' in the system. This task is followed by the 'Scoring request' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends a 'Scoring Send inquiry to Schufasystem' task.

Once the 'Scoring immediately determined?' message is received, the 'Create a Result' task is triggered. This task is connected to the 'EndEvent0' which is triggered when the 'Get delay message' is received.

The 'Scoring immediately determined?' message also triggers the 'Send notification to sales staff' task. This task is connected to the 'Results obtained' message, which in turn triggers the 'Sending result to the sales representative' task.

In summary, the process involves picking up 'Schufascroing' in the system, scoring it, sending an inquiry to the Schufasystem, and finally notifying the sales staff based on the scoring results.
