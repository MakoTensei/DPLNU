 The Credit Transfer Frontend Bank initiates the process with the StartEvent0, which then proceeds to the ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway directs the flow to Activity 1 and subsequently to ParallelGateway2, which ultimately leads to the EndEvent0. Meanwhile, Activity 2, triggered by StartEvent0, is directed to ExclusiveGateway0, which in turn sends it to EndEvent0. Additionally, StartEvent1 initiates Scoring Level 1, which is routed to Scoring Level 2 through ExclusiveGateway1, and both scoring levels conclude at their respective EndEvent1.
