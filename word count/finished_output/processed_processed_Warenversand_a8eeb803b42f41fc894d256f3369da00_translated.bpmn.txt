 When goods are sent, the process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'Offers from three freight forwarders enroll' task. This task connects with 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn leads to the 'Explanation' task. The 'Explanation' task, prompted by the question of whether insurance is necessary, branches out to 'Insurance necessary?' tasks. These tasks connect with 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'InclusiveGateway3', both of which lead to 'ParallelGateway5'.


If the insurance is deemed necessary, the 'InclusiveGateway3' task is triggered, which then connects to the 'Filling the package note' task. This task, in turn, leads to the 'Complete insurance' task, which also connects to 'ParallelGateway5'.


If the insurance is not necessary, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' task is triggered, which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5' task.


Regardless of the insurance decision, the 'ParallelGateway5' task connects to the 'Delivering goods' task, which concludes the process with the 'Goods delivered' event.
