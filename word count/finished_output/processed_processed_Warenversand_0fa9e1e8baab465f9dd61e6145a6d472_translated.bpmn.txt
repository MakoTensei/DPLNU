 The process begins with the 'Here we go' event, which triggers the 'At 3 forwarding' task, leading to a question prompt. From there, the user selects a forwarding option, which initiates the 'Appoint forwarding' task. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', and upon completion, it leads to the 'Good quality' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Here we go' event also triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4'. The goods are then packaged and sent to the 'ParallelGateway5', where the 'Sekreteriat creates parcel certificate' task is initiated. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', and upon completion, it leads to the 'Good quality' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Sekreteriat creates parcel certificate' task is also connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which leads to the 'Good quality' event.

Lastly, the 'Complete insurance' task is initiated from the 'ExclusiveGateway2', and it is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which leads to the 'Good quality' event.

In summary, the process involves multiple tasks and gateways, starting with the 'Here we go' event, leading to the creation of a parcel certificate, packaging of goods, appointment of forwarding, and completion of insurance, all culminating in the 'Good quality' event.
