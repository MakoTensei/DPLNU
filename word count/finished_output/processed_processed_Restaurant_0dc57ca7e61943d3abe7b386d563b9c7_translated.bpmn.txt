 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural language description:

1. When an order is received, the system triggers the preparation of the meal, and the event "providing meal" is initiated.

2. Upon obtaining the order, the system retrieves the guest, and the event "Retrieve guest" is triggered.

3. If the guest feels hungry, they add their order, which triggers the event "Add your order."

4. The system then prepares the meal and makes it available to the guest, marking the event "Meals made available."

5. After a 5-minute delay, the system finishes the order, and the event "Order finished" is triggered.

6. Finally, the guest eats the meal, and their hunger is distilled, marking the event "Hunger distilled."
