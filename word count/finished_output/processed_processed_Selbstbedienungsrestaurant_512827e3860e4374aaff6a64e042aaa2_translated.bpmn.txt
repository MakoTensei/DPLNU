 Let's describe the flow of events in a natural, conversive way:

1. A customer experiences hunger, which triggers the start of their visit to the restaurant.
2. The customer arrives at the restaurant and is greeted by the staff.
3. The customer is then prompted to choose their dish from the menu.
4. After selecting their dish, the customer proceeds to the payment process.
5. Upon completing the payment, the customer receives their pieper (a term used in the context of this flow).
6. The customer starts eating their meal, which leads to the restaurant staff adjusting the pieper (potentially referring to the portion size or order).
7. The customer's order is then retrieved by the restaurant staff, and the food is prepared.
8. The food is delivered to the customer, and the order is considered complete.

In parallel, the following events occur:

- EventBasedGateway0 handles the intermediate catch events, such as when the customer waits for their pieper or when the food is ready to be delivered.
- EventBasedGateway0 also handles the 5-minute timer, which may be used to ensure timely service or to manage the flow of customers.

Start and end events:

- StartEvent1 initiates the process when the customer feels hungry.
- StartEvent2 is triggered when the food preparation begins.
- Famine is the end event, which occurs when the customer's hunger is satisfied.
- Order End is the final event, signifying the completion of the customer's order.
- Preparation end marks the end of the food preparation process.
