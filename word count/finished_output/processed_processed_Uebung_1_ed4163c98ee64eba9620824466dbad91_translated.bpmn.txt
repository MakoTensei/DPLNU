 In the process of providing goods, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Providing goods' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5' and leads to 'Filling the package note' and 'Packaging goods'. The 'Filling the package note' task requires 'Check insurance requirements' and is linked to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Once the insurance requirements are checked, the process moves to 'Insurance close' which is connected to 'Insurance necessary?' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

After the insurance is confirmed, the 'Packaging goods' task is completed and the goods are ready for pick up. The 'Pick up offers of spediture' task is initiated, which is connected to 'Lot?' and leads to 'Select your offer'. The 'Select your offer' task is linked to 'Lot?' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Once the offer is selected, the 'Specialist' task is triggered, which is connected to 'Lot?' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' task then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' is triggered, which is connected to 'Insurance necessary?' and marks the completion of the process. The goods are now ready for dispatch and delivery.
