 In a business process flow, various tasks and gateways interact to ensure smooth operations. Let's explore the following scenario:

When a report indicating a "Possibility to take action" arrives, it triggers the "Reporting\nPossibility to take action" event. This event then connects to the "ExclusiveGateway2," which has two possible outcomes: "Process\nclose" or "ExclusiveGateway2."
