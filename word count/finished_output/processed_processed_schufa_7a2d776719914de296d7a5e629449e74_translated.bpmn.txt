 In the scoring process, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' and then moves to 'StartEvent1'. The first event triggers the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which checks the 'Debt' and has an incoming connection from 'StartEvent1'. This task then connects to the 'Is the result fixed?' event, which is an outgoing connection from the 'Level 1 scoring' task.

The 'Level 1 scoring' task is followed by the 'Level 2 scoring' task, which has an incoming connection from the 'Level 1 scoring' task and connects to the'sid-8D0ADC68-A29B-45F1-A9D3-03D62F32D8F8' gateway. This gateway is part of the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and has an outgoing connection to the'scoring determined' event.

The'scoring determined' event is then connected to the 'Delay' event, which is part of the 'EventBasedGateway2' and has an outgoing connection to the'sid-120EDDEC-CCF3-4A5D-9607-0763BAC9E643' event.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0', moves to 'StartEvent1', and then proceeds through the 'Level 1 scoring' and 'Level 2 scoring' tasks, which connect to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'EventBasedGateway2' respectively. The'scoring determined' event connects to the 'Delay' event, which finally leads to the 'EndEvent1'.
