 In the process of handling a shipment, the system begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway then leads to the 'Check quantity' task, which determines the required quantity of goods. Once the quantity is determined, the system proceeds to the 'Spediteur or post' task, which involves selecting a shipping service or postal service for the delivery.

Simultaneously, the 'Check quantity' task also connects to the 'Select the Spediteur' task, which allows the user to choose a shipping service based on the determined quantity. The 'Spediteur or post' task also has an outgoing connection to the 'Is all due?' task, which checks if all the goods have been packaged and are ready for delivery.

The 'ParallelGateway4' also connects to the 'Pickup' task, which is triggered when the 'Is all due?' task confirms that all goods are ready for pickup. This task then leads to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the pickup process.

In case of any insolvency issues, the 'Insolvency' task is triggered by the 'Insurance?' task, which connects to the 'Pickup ready' task. This task ensures that the pickup is ready and can proceed even in the event of insolvency.

Overall, the system ensures a smooth and efficient process from determining the quantity of goods, selecting a shipping service, packaging the goods, and finally picking up the shipment, while also handling any potential insolvency issues.
