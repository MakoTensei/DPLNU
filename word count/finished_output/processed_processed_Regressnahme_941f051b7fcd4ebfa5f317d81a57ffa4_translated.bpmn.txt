 When a possible regression is detected, the system initiates a series of tasks to address the issue. First, a payment request is sent to Vietnam to handle the situation. This request is then followed by a process for resubmission, which is contingent on the presence of a regression claim. Once the claim is confirmed, the case is handed over to the debt collection team.

Simultaneously, the system checks for any opposition from Vietnam and, if justified, the process enters a state of processing. During this time, the system also monitors for any events that may require attention.

If the opposition is not justified, the system proceeds to close the case after booking the entrance. However, if the opposition is justified, the process continues in processing.

Throughout this process, the system communicates with various gateways. The 'Regression claim is there?' gateway determines whether a regression claim exists and directs the case to either the debt collection team or the process in processing. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway is responsible for handling the case handover to debt collection and closing the process after booking the entrance.

In summary, the system handles possible regressions by sending payment requests, processing resubmissions, and managing debt collection. It also monitors for opposition and events, ensuring that the process is handled efficiently and effectively.
