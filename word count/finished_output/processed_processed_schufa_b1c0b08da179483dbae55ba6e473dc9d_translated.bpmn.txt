 In the event of a scoring process, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Transfer Level 1 scoring' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Delay scoring?' request to the 'Delay scoring?' gateway, which in turn sends a 'Transfer Level 1 scoring' task to the 'Transfer Level 1 scoring' gateway. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent1' event triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1' which sends a 'Delay level 1' request to the 'Delay level 1' gateway and a 'Send a reply' task to the 'Send a reply' gateway. The 'Delay level 1' gateway then reports the delay to the 'Report delay to Frontend' gateway. Meanwhile, the 'Transfer Level 1 scoring' gateway sends the 'Level 1 Scoring' task to the 'Level 2 Scoring' gateway. The 'Level 2 Scoring' gateway then sends the 'Sending result Level 2' task to the 'Sending result Level 2' endpoint. The 'Send a reply' gateway sends a 'Finished' task to the 'Finished' endpoint. The 'Report delay to Frontend' gateway sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' gateway. Finally, the 'Level 2 Scoring' gateway sends the 'Sending result Level 2' task to the 'Sending result Level 2' endpoint, completing the scoring process.
