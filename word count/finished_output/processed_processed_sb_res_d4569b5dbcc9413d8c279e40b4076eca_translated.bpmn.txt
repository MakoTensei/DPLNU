 Let's break down the sequence of events and tasks into a more natural flow:

1. The user experiences hunger, triggering the event 'Hunger'.
2. The user decides to visit a restaurant, which sends a 'Report to employees' event.
3. The user places an order at the restaurant, leading to the 'Order to receive' event.
4. The restaurant prepares the meal, resulting in the 'Make a meal available' event.
5. The user receives the meal and enjoys it, completing the 'Meals finished' event.
6. The restaurant sends a signal to the kitchen, initiating the 'Signal received' event.
7. The kitchen adjusts the meal, causing the 'Adjust Pieper' event.
8. The meal is handed over to the user, leading to the 'Hand over meal' event.
9. The user reports back to the restaurant, triggering the 'Guest reports' event.
10. The restaurant processes the guest's report, resulting in the 'Hand over meal' event again.

This sequence of events and tasks concludes with the user's satisfaction, represented by the 'Famine' event, which is resolved when the user receives the prepared meal.
