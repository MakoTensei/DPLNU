 The system initiates a check for potential regression in the Vietnamese (VN) system, as indicated by the event 'VN may be in Regression we have taken'. This triggers the 'Regression\nRight?' gateway, which upon confirmation, leads to the 'Regression process\nFinished' event, marking the completion of the regression check.


Simultaneously, the system also monitors for opposition, with the event 'EventBasedGateway3' serving as an incoming trigger. This event connects to the 'Opposition\njustified' gateway, which, upon processing, also leads to the 'Regression process\nFinished' event, indicating that the opposition has been justified and the regression check has been completed.


Additionally, the system tracks incoming payments through 'EventBasedGateway3', which also connects to the 'Regression process\nFinished' event, signifying that the payment has been processed and the regression check has been concluded.


Lastly, the system keeps an eye on the reimbursement period, with the event 'Reimbursement period Expired' leading to the 'Regression process\nFinished' event, indicating that the reimbursement period has expired and the regression check has been finalized.


In summary, the system's flow of events and gateways ensures that the regression check is completed after confirming potential regression, opposition, payments, and expired reimbursement periods.
