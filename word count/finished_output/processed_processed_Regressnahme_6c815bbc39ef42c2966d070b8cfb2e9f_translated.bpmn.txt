 The process begins with a 'Regression check' initiated by the 'Regression check\nStart' event. This event triggers the 'Regression claim?' gateway, which in turn sets the process for resubmission and closes the claim.

Simultaneously, the 'EventBasedGateway3' event is triggered, which leads to two possible outcomes:

1. If the 'Regression claim?' is justified, the process proceeds without payment and closes, leading to the 'Procedure without payment\nclosed' event.
2. If the 'Regression claim?' is not justified, the process continues with the debtor and delivers the payment, leading to the 'Process\ndebtor\ndelivered' event.

In both cases, the 'EventBasedGateway3' also triggers the 'Debt collection service provider' gateway, which processes the debtor and delivers the payment.

Meanwhile, the 'Payment\nReport' event is triggered, which sets the process for resubmission and closes the process with incoming payment.

Lastly, the 'Opposition\nReport' event is triggered, which leads to the closure of the process without payment.

The process concludes with the 'Closed' event, which signifies the end of the process.
