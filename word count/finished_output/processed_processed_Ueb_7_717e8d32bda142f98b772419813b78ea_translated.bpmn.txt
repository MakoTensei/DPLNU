 In the system, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process and forward requests and reports related to Schufascoring.

1. The process begins with a 'Schufascoring request\nReport' event, which triggers the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This gateway forwards the request to 'Request edited' and 'Delay message\nReport' tasks.

2. The 'Request edited' task takes the 'Result\nLevel 2\nReport' and sends it to the 'Level 2 Return to Frontend' gateway.

3. The 'Delay message\nReport' task receives the 'Schufascoring request\nReport' and sends a 'forward delay message' to the 'perform scoring level 2' task.

4. The 'perform scoring level 2' task checks if the results are available and forwards the 'Result Level 2 forward' to the 'Scoring request' task.

5. The 'Scoring request' task receives the 'Results available?' and sends a 'Result Level 2 forward' to the 'Level 2 Return to Frontend' gateway.

6. The 'Level 2 Return to Frontend' gateway receives the 'Result Level 2 forward' and sends a 'Request edited' to the 'Result\nLevel 2\nReport' task.

7. The 'Result\nLevel 2\nReport' task receives the 'Request edited' and sends a 'Send result to Bank' task.

8. The 'Send result to Bank' task sends the final 'Result Level 2' to the 'Scoring request' task.

9. The 'Scoring request' task receives the 'Result Level 2' and sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Results available?' gateway.

10. The 'Results available?' gateway receives the 'Scoring request' and sends a 'perform scoring level 1' task.

11. The 'perform scoring level 1' task checks the results and sends a 'Check the results' task to the 'Request\nReport' gateway.

12. The 'Request\nReport' gateway receives the 'Check the results' and sends a 'Results available?' task to the 'Check the results' gateway.
