 The system initiates a "Scoring request" process, identified by the unique ID'sid-44452E63-BA13-4C23-AC2F-760271950806', which begins with the 'Start' command and is designed to route exclusively to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Concurrently, a "Share delay" operation, tagged with ID'sid-E8ABBE64-426C-4CD0-965C-8FFDA9E83941', also commences with the 'Start' command, but instead of proceeding to 'ExclusiveGateway1', it diverts to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. Lastly, the "Share result" task, marked by ID'sid-36FC7617-B7F3-405E-9023-EFF4AFA31D4A', also starts with 'Start' and is set to forward its output to 'Process'. All these tasks are interconnected, starting with a 'Start' command and sharing the same incoming sequence 'Start\nScoring request', but they diverge in their outgoing paths.
