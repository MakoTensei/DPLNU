 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Prepare customer data' task, which then sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'Scoring request' task. This task, in turn, sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to the 'Generate delay message' task. The 'Generate delay message' task sends a message to the 'Result?' gateway, which then sends an 'EndEvent1' to the 'Scoring (level 1)' task.

The 'Scoring (level 1)' task sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then sends an 'EndEvent1' to the 'Prepare customer data' task. The 'StartEvent1' triggers the 'Generate delay message' task, which sends a message to the 'Result?' gateway, which then sends an 'EndEvent1' to the 'Scoring (level 2)' task.

The 'Scoring (level 2)' task sends a 'Scoring request' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then sends an 'EndEvent1' to the 'Prepare customer data' task. The 'StartEvent0' triggers the 'Prepare customer data' task, which then sends a 'Scoringergeb.\nto prepare' message to the 'EndEvent0' task.

In summary, the process involves preparing customer data, scoring at two levels, and generating delay messages at various points in the process. The 'Result?' gateway serves as a final checkpoint, and the 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' tasks mark the completion of the process.
