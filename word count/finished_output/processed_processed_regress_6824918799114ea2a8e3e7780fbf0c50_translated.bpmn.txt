 The process begins with the receipt of a Regression report, which triggers an examination of the case and directs it to ExclusiveGateway1. If the report indicates a possible regression against VN, the process moves to ExclusiveGateway4, where a VN payment request is sent, and a process for resubmission is set. Upon receiving a cash receipt from VN, the process proceeds to ExclusiveGateway4 again, where an internal regression measure is completed.


Concurrently, if the Regression report suggests that an objection is justified, the process diverts to ExclusiveGateway3, where the VN case is delivered to the debt collection service provider. Meanwhile, if the Regression report does not indicate a regression against VN, the process continues to ExclusiveGateway1, where an opposition is received and processed.


Upon completion of the internal regression measure, the process moves to Book the entrance, which also leads to an internal regression measure completion. If the opposition is justified, the process transitions to ExclusiveGateway3, where the RF case is delivered to the debt collection service provider.


Lastly, if the Regression report indicates that the reimbursement period has expired, the process is directed to ExclusiveGateway1, where the RF case is delivered to the debt collection service provider.


In summary, the process involves a series of checks and transitions based on the Regression report, opposition, VN payment, and reimbursement period status, ultimately leading to either an internal regression measure completion or the delivery of the RF case to the debt collection service provider.
