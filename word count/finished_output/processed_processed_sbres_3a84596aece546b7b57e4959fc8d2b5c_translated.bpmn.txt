 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and conversational way:

1. A guest feels hungry, triggering the "Hunger" event.
2. The guest places an order, which leads to the "Accept Order" event.
3. The order is then sent to the "EventBasedGateway0" to determine the next steps.
4. The order is processed and sent to the kitchen, where it is prepared.
5. The kitchen notifies the "EventBasedGateway0" that the food is ready.
6. The kitchen also sends a notification to the "Pick up food" event.
7. The "Pick up food" event informs the "EventBasedGateway0" that the food is ready to be served.
8. The "EventBasedGateway0" sends the guest a notification to pick up the food.
9. The guest picks up the food and reacts to it, which triggers the "Guest reacts to Pieper" event.
10. The "Pick up food" event is completed, and the guest is notified that the food is ready to be delivered.
11. The guest receives the food, and the "Deliver food" event is completed.
12. The guest is satisfied with the food, and the "EndEvent1" event is triggered.
13. The guest is retrieved, and the "Pappsate" event is completed.
14. The "EndEvent2" event is triggered, marking the end of the process.
