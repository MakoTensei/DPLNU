 The process begins with the 'Goods be sent' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway4' to initiate the pickup of offers. The offers are then passed to the 'Special delivery\nno man?' gateway, which in turn directs the offers to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then sends the offers to the 'Choose your favorite' task, where the customer selects their favorite offer.

The 'Choose your favorite' task sends the selected offer to the 'Specialist' gateway, which then directs the offer to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends the offer to the 'Filling the package note' task, where the package note is filled with the selected offer.

The 'Check shipping quantity' task is triggered, which sends the goods to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'ExclusiveGateway3' then sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' sends the goods to the 'Goods for collection' task, which in turn sends the goods to the 'EndEvent0'.
