 In a business process flow, the following sequence of events and gateways occur:

1. The process begins with the event "VN to Regression taken they are," which triggers a payment request to be sent.
2. The payment request is sent to the gateway "Payment request send," which then leads to the possibility of regressing.
3. If the possibility of regressing is confirmed, the gateway "set to reimbursement" is triggered, and the money report is generated.
4. The money report is then processed, leading to the gateway "Money is Report," which closes the process.
5. If the possibility of regressing is not confirmed, the process proceeds to the gateway "Proceedings," which also closes the process.
6. In the case of proceedings, if VN contradicts, the process moves to the gateway "VN contradicts," which then leads to the tax payable on collection.
7. If the possibility of regressing is confirmed, the process moves to the gateway "EventBasedGateway2," which closes the process and leads to the tax payable on collection.
8. The tax payable on collection is then processed, leading to the gateway "Tax payable on Collection," which closes the process.

This sequence of events and gateways ensures that the business process is handled appropriately based on the incoming and outgoing events.
