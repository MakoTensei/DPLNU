 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Review Size of the product' task. This task is responsible for reviewing the size of the product and sends a 'Lot?' to the 'Lot?' gateway. The 'Lot?' gateway then sends the product to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' which in turn sends the product to the 'EndEvent0'.

Next, the 'Selection of offers' task is triggered by the 'Lot?' gateway. This task selects the offers and sends them to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the product to the 'Recreation' task, which is responsible for recreation activities.

The 'Recreation' task sends the product to the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Selection of offers' task. The 'Selection of offers' task sends the product to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent0'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the product to the 'Adhesive insurance cover' task, which is responsible for attaching the insurance cover to the product. The 'Adhesive insurance cover' task sends the product to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' sends the product to the 'EndEvent0' which marks the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Review Size of the product' task. The product is then sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' which sends it to the 'Recreation' task. The 'Recreation' task sends the product to the 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Selection of offers' task. The 'Selection of offers' task sends the product to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and 'EndEvent0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends the product to the 'Adhesive insurance cover' task, which sends the product to the 'ParallelGateway5'. Finally, the 'ParallelGateway5' sends the product to the 'EndEvent0', marking the end of the process.
