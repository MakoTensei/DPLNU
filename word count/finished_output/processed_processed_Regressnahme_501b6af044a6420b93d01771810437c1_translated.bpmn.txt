 In a business process flow, a case is first checked upon registration, which triggers the ExclusiveGateway0. This leads to the parallel processing of the case and the Proceedings. The case is then transferred to the Transfer process, while the Proceedings result in a Regret done. Meanwhile, the Registration event also leads to the ExclusiveGateway1, where it triggers the Regret done and Transfer process. The EventBasedGateway2, which receives the parallel processing of the case, sends the Get money event to the ExclusiveGateway1. The VN\n\n event, which originates from the ParallelGateway3, leads to the Transfer process and the Reimbursed process. The Cash receipt event, triggered by the case check, sends Get money to the Cash receipt process. Finally, the Process event, originating from ExclusiveGateway0, concludes the entire business process flow.
