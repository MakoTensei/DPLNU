 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Pick up offers - Order Spediteur' task, which then sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway forwards the request to 'Comparison', which in turn sends a request to 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' task is then followed by 'Goods ready for dispatch', which is triggered by 'StartEvent0' and does not send any requests to other tasks.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also triggers 'Packaging goods' task, which sends a request to 'ParallelGateway3'. This gateway then sends a request to 'Signature Package Ticket', which in turn sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task sends a request to 'Goods ready for dispatch', which is triggered by 'StartEvent0' and does not send any requests to other tasks.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent1' triggers the 'Create a quote' task, which sends a request to 'Send a quote'. This task then triggers 'EndEvent0', which does not send any requests to other tasks.

In summary, the process involves the 'StartEvent0' triggering multiple tasks and gateways, with 'Goods ready for dispatch' and 'Send a quote' being the final tasks in the process.
