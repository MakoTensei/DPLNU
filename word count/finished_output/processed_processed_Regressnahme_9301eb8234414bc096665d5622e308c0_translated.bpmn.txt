 When a message indicating a possible regression is received, the system initiates a series of tasks and interactions between various components to address the situation. Here's a natural flow of the described process:

1. A message indicating a possible regression is received, triggering the StartEvent1.
2. The system checks if the regression is justified, which leads to the Gateway 'VN can be taken in regression?' and the ExclusiveGateway1.
3. If the regression is justified, the system shares the information on debt collection and completes the process.
4. If the opposition is justified, the system shares the information on debt collection and completes the process.
5. If the opposition is not justified, the system proceeds to check the regression request.
6. If the regression is justified, the system processes the reimbursement and sends a notification for the regression pay.
7. If the regression is not justified, the system sends an objection notification.
8. The system book the entrance to further investigate the regression possibility.
9. The process ends when the EventBasedGateway4 concludes the investigation.

In summary, the system handles the possible regression by checking if it's justified, sharing information on debt collection, completing the process, and sending notifications for reimbursement or objection. The process ends when the investigation is concluded.
