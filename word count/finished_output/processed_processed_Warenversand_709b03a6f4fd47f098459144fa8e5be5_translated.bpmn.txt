 When a shipment of goods arrives, the system initiates two processes: providing for collection and assessing special shipment requirements. If the shipment is a special shipment, the system offers special deals and directs the process to ExclusiveGateway3. If the shipment is not special, the system proceeds to provide for collection and routes the process to ParallelGateway4.

In the case of a special shipment, the system also checks if insurance is required. If insurance is needed, the process goes through ExclusiveGateway2, which connects to Insurance? and forwards the process to ExclusiveGateway3. If insurance is not required, the process goes directly to ExclusiveGateway3.

Once the goods are collected, the system checks if insurance was requested. If insurance was requested, the process goes through ExclusiveGateway2, which connects to Insurance? and forwards the process to ParallelGateway4. If insurance was not requested, the process goes directly to ParallelGateway4.

In summary, the system handles the shipment of goods by providing for collection, assessing special shipment requirements, and checking for insurance needs. The processes are routed through various gateways based on the incoming and outgoing tasks, ensuring a smooth flow of operations.
