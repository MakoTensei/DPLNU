 When a "Regression report" is received, it triggers the "Regression\npossible" gateway, which in turn initiates the creation of a "Payment request\nCreating" and closes the "Process\nclosed" event. Concurrently, the "Regression\npossible" gateway also leads to the "EventBasedGateway3" where the "Opposition\nCheck" task is processed, resulting in the "ExclusiveGateway2" and "Process\nclosed" events.

Meanwhile, the "Payment request\nCreating" task is completed, and the "Payment\nReport" is received, which closes the "Process\nclosed" event. The "Opposition\nReport" task is also processed at "EventBasedGateway3", leading to the "Process\nclosed" event.

Additionally, the "1 week" event at "EventBasedGateway3" opens a new process.

Finally, the "Process\nclosed" event is triggered, which is the culmination of the "Regression report" event, and it has incoming events from "EventBasedGateway3", "Regression\npossible", and "Opposition\nReport".
