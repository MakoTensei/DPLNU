 In the workflow, a 'Regression report g' initiates the process, triggering a 'VN payment request' which is then routed to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway receives the 'Regression report g' and sends a 'WV set' to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Concurrently, 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives an 'EventBasedGateway4' and routes it to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'WV set' from 'ExclusiveGateway0' is also received by 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then sends a 'Reasons\nReport' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway2' also receives 'EventBasedGateway4' from 'ExclusiveGateway1' and sends it to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Reasons\nReport' from 'ExclusiveGateway2' is received by 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn sends an 'EndEvent0' to 'End Events'. The 'VN payment request' is also routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The 'Payment confirmed' event is triggered by 'Demands' and sends a 'Close' event to 'End Events'. Lastly, the 'Reimbursement\nDate of expiry' event is received by 'ExclusiveGateway2' and sends a 'WV set' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
