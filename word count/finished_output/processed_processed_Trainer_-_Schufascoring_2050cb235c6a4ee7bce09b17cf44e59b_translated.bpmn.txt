 In a scoring process, a StartEvent0 initiates the sequence by triggering a Report Level 2 task, which is responsible for reporting the initial scoring results. Concurrently, a StartEvent1 kicks off the submission process, leading to a Submitting results task.

As the scoring progresses, a Scoring request task is triggered, which sends a time delay signal to the IntermediateCatchEvent4. This event acts as a checkpoint, ensuring that the scoring process is on track before proceeding.

ParallelGateway1 receives the Run scoring level 1 task from StartEvent1, which then leads to the Submitting results task. This task is responsible for submitting the intermediate scoring results.

The Run scoring level 2 task, originating from StartEvent1, is directed to Submitting results, which in turn sends the results to the Results obtained gateway. This gateway concludes the scoring process by finalizing the results.

Throughout the process, the IntermediateCatchEvent4 and IntermediateCatchEvent2 act as checkpoints, ensuring that the scoring process is proceeding smoothly. The IntermediateCatchEvent4 is triggered by the Scoring request task, while the IntermediateCatchEvent2 is triggered by the Run scoring level 1 task.

In summary, the scoring process begins with StartEvent0 and StartEvent1, leading to the submission of intermediate results and final scoring results. The process is monitored and controlled by various tasks and gateways, ensuring a smooth and efficient scoring process.
