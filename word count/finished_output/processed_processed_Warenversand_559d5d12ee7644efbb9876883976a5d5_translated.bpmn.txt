 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' event, which triggers the 'Filling standardised parcel note' task. This task has an incoming trigger from the 'Soder, or normal shipment?' gateway, and its outgoing trigger is the 'Insurance Check' task. The 'Insurance Check' task, in turn, has an incoming trigger from the 'Goods are to be shipped' event and an outgoing trigger to the 'ParallelGateway2'.

The 'ParallelGateway2' gateway has two incoming triggers: 'Packaging goods' and 'Insurance Check'. Its outgoing trigger is the 'EndEvent1'. The 'EndEvent1' has an incoming trigger from the 'Soder, or normal shipment?' gateway and no outgoing triggers.

The 'EndEvent0' has an incoming trigger from the 'Soder, or normal shipment?' gateway and no outgoing triggers.

In summary, the process flows as follows:

1. 'Goods are to be shipped' event triggers 'Filling standardised parcel note' task.
2. 'Filling standardised parcel note' task triggers 'Insurance Check' task.
3. 'Insurance Check' task triggers 'ParallelGateway2'.
4. 'ParallelGateway2' triggers 'EndEvent1'.
5. 'EndEvent1' triggers 'Soder, or normal shipment?' gateway.
6. 'Soder, or normal shipment?' gateway triggers 'EndEvent0'.

This process ensures that the goods are shipped, packaged, insured, and the shipment decision is made before the process concludes.
