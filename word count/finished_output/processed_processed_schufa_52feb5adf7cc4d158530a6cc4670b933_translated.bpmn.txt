 In the system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Start scoring request' task, leading to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent1' where the scoring request is forwarded. Concurrently, 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Report delay' task, which does not have any outgoing connections. The 'StartEvent1' then kicks off the '1. perform scoring' task, which is directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then sends the 'Scoring result sent' message and also handles the 'Send delay message' task. Meanwhile, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'forward scoring results' task, which is connected to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', resulting in the 'Report delay' message being sent. Overall, the system efficiently manages the scoring process, ensuring that results are sent and any delays are reported accordingly.
