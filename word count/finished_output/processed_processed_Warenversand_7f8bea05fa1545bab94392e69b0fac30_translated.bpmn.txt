 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the pick-up of offers from the shipping company, which is then passed to 'Pick up offers from spediteure'. The offers are then 'Control and select offers', which in turn triggers 'Order to forwarders'. The 'Order to forwarders' leads to the 'Package shipped' event, which is a result of the 'Special shipment?' event. Concurrently, the 'Special shipment?' event also triggers the creation of insurance, which is then followed by 'Package shipped'. The 'Filling the package note' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway2', which sends the package to be shipped. Meanwhile, 'Packaging goods' is also sent to 'ParallelGateway3', which then sends the package for shipping. The 'Create insurance' task is also connected to 'ParallelGateway2', which sends the package for shipping. The process concludes with the 'Package shipped' event, which is triggered by 'Special shipment?', 'Insurance?', and 'ParallelGateway2'.
