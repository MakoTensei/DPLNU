 In the world of a scoring system, a series of tasks and gateways work together to process requests and share results. Let's dive into the flow of this system:

1. The process begins with a 'Request started' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway is responsible for handling the initial request and directing it to the appropriate path.

2. The 'Request request' event initiates the 'Share result' task, which is responsible for sharing the results with the frontend.

3. The 'EventBasedGateway2' receives the 'Request started' event and sends the request to the 'Report to Frontend' task. This task is responsible for generating a report and sending it to the frontend.

4. The 'perform first scoring' task is triggered by the 'ParallelGateway3' and sends the request to the 'Transfer to Level 2\n' task. This task is responsible for transferring the request to the next level of the scoring process.

5. The 'Transfer to Level 2\n' task sends the request to the 'ParallelGateway4' task, which is responsible for further processing and eventually transferring the request to the 'EndEvent2'.

6. The 'Results obtained' task is triggered by the'sid-270EC174-38D9-4D04-B356-E8D9142111DF' event and sends the results to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then directs the results to the 'EndEvent0' task, which marks the completion of the scoring process.

7. The 'immediately\nResult?' task is triggered by the'sid-133B7173-8E04-4429-BD1B-654BD20493FA' event and sends the results to the 'EndEvent1' task. This task marks the completion of the result sharing process.

8. The 'Transfer to Bank\n' task is triggered by the'sid-1FF5145B-DD02-4EBE-911B-72882F9CAC
