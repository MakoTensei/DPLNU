 When a Schufa scoring request is initiated, the system first invites the customer's consent through the 'Any consent?' gateway, which has the ID'sid-AAF5F2A1-B375-4994-9591-4225993F2370'. If the customer consents, the system proceeds to the 'Schufa request' gateway, identified by'sid-A78F76EA-27A3-46A0-807A-C10DF0385098', to initiate the Schufa scoring process.

The 'Schufa request' gateway then sends a 'Request result' to the 'Scoring Level 1' gateway, with the ID'sid-2DEE9180-A15A-43B4-9B9E-FA3AD0D96073', which processes the request and generates the initial scoring result.

If there is a delay in the scoring process, the 'Delay\n(x min)' gateway, identified by'sid-12ABB8EE-3583-4FA4-9F36-9FFCB412CE90', is triggered. This gateway sends the delay information back to the 'Scoring Level 1' gateway, which then updates the request result accordingly.

The 'Scoring Level 1' gateway sends the updated request result to the 'End' event, identified by'sid-C8A54A07-E514-4ED7-AFD7-24E36255449D', marking the completion of the scoring process.
