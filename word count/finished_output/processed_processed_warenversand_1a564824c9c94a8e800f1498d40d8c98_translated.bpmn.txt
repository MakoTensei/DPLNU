 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be sent.' which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' which then leads to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task is responsible for determining the insurance requirements for the goods. This task is connected to the 'Determining insurance requirements' task which in turn leads to the 'Goods delivered' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Goods are to be sent.' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is followed by the 'Complete insurance' task which is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Complete insurance' task leads to the 'ParallelGateway8' task.

The 'Pick up offers' task is also connected to the 'Packaging goods' task which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway6'. This task is followed by the 'Filling the package note' task which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'.

Lastly, the 'ParallelGateway8' task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' which leads to the 'Goods delivered' event.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods are to be sent.' event, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways that ultimately lead to the 'Goods delivered' event. The process involves tasks such as 'Pick up offers', 'Determining insurance requirements', 'Filling the package note', and 'Packaging goods', and gateways such as 'ExclusiveGateway0', 'ExclusiveGateway1', and 'ParallelGateway5'.
