 The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task with incoming data from 'ParallelGateway2'. The packaged goods are then delivered by the 'Deliver packaged goods' task, which receives data from 'ParallelGateway3' and outputs 'Good quality'. The 'Clearing the shipping mode' task follows, taking in data from 'ParallelGateway2' and sending it to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'Filling the package note' task also starts with 'ParallelGateway2' and results in 'Good quality'. The 'Get 3 quotes' task is initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway0', leading to the 'Order selected forwarding' task, which in turn sends data to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Complete insurance' task, triggered by 'ExclusiveGateway1', sends data to 'ParallelGateway3' as well. Finally, the 'Good quality' event is generated, receiving data from 'ExclusiveGateway0' and marking the end of the process.
