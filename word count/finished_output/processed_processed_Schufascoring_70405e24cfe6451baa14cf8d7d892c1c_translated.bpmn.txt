 When a Schufaservice scoring request is received, it triggers a series of events and interactions between different components in the system. The process begins with the 'Schufascoring request has been received' event, which initiates the 'Level 2 request?' gateway. This gateway then sends an 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' to signal the completion of the initial request processing.

The 'StartEvent1' event is triggered next, which sends a 'Response message Level 2 request required' to the 'Response message Level 2 request required' gateway. This gateway responds by sending an 'AntLevel 2 process request' to the 'AntLevel 2 process request' gateway.

The 'AntLevel 2 process request' gateway then sends an 'EndEvent2' to indicate the completion of the intermediate processing. Meanwhile, the 'Answer to Frontend' event is triggered, which sends an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway sends an 'EndEvent1' to signal the completion of the intermediate event. Finally, the 'Schufa answer request' event is triggered, which sends a 'Level 2?' to the 'Level 2?' gateway. This gateway responds by sending an 'EndEvent3' to indicate the completion of the final request processing.

In summary, the process starts with the reception of a Schufaservice scoring request, which triggers a series of events and interactions between different gateways and end events, ultimately leading to the completion of the request processing.
