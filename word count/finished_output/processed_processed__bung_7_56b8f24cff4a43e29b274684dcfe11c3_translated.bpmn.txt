 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Scoring request' task, which then leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. This event is responsible for passing the request to the 'Report delay' task, which in turn initiates the 'BANK inform' task. The 'BANK inform' task concludes with the 'EndEvent2'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Test level 1' task, which leads to the 'Ergebnixs?' task. The 'Ergebnixs?' task concludes with the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' also triggers the 'Info on Frontend' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'StartEvent1' triggers the 'BANK inform' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent2'. It also initiates the 'Customer information' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent4'.

The 'StartEvent2' triggers the 'Start request for credit award' task, which leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. This event concludes with the 'EndEvent4'.

The 'Declaration of consent?' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', leads to the 'EndEvent1'.

The 'Ergebnixs?' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', also leads to the 'EndEvent3'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' task, triggered by 'Scoring request', concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' task, triggered by 'StartEvent0', concludes with the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task, triggered by 'StartEvent2', concludes with the 'EndEvent4'.

The 'EventBasedGateway2' task, triggered by 'StartEvent0' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', concludes with the 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0' and involves various tasks and events that lead to the completion of 'EndEvent4'. The tasks and events are interconnected, with some tasks triggering multiple events and others being
