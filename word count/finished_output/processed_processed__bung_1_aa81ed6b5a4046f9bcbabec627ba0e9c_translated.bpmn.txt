 In the process of handling an offer, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'ParallelGateway6'. This gateway then sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway7'. 'ParallelGateway5' is responsible for packaging the offer and sends the packaged offer to 'ParallelGateway7'. 'ParallelGateway7' then sends the offer to 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Offer 2' process begins with 'StartEvent0' and follows a similar path. It sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway5'. 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the offer to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Apply meal' process starts with 'StartEvent0' and sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway5'. 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the offer to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Determine quantity' process starts with 'StartEvent0' and sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway6'. 'ParallelGateway6' sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway7' and 'ParallelGateway7' sends the offer to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Check insurance' process starts with 'StartEvent0' and sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway6'. 'ParallelGateway6' sends the offer to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway5' sends the offer to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
