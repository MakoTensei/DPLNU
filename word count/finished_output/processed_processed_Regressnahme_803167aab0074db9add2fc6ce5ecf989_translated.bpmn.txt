 The process begins with a communication about a possible regression against VN, which triggers a series of tasks and gateways. The first task, 'Send payment request', is initiated to address the potential regression. This task is connected to the 'Regress possible?' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'Debt collection service process Leister' if an opposition is raised.

If the opposition is not raised, the 'Define re-submission date' task is triggered, leading to the 'Reimbursement Date of Expiry' gateway. This gateway then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which can either proceed to the 'Process completed with cash receipt' if the re-submission date is defined or go back to the 'Debt collection service process Leister' if the re-submission date is not defined.

On the other hand, if the opposition is raised, the process diverts to the 'Debt collection service process Leister' and then to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This gateway leads to the 'Process completed with cash receipt' if the debt collection process is successful.

In the end, the process can either be completed with a cash receipt or without a regression, depending on the outcomes of the tasks and gateways.
