 Starting with the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Regression possibility\nReport' event triggers the 'Order of payment Ship merchandise' task, which involves checking the case and ordering the shipment of merchandise.

2. The 'Order of payment Ship merchandise' task sends an 'ExclusiveGateway2' message, which leads to the 'Regression\nwithout result\nclosed' task. This task is closed without any results due to the regression possibility.

3. Meanwhile, the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event also triggers the 'Set process in WV' task, which sets the process in the WV system.

4. The 'Set process in WV' task sends an 'ExclusiveGateway2' message, which leads to the 'Regression\ndebt collection\nforwarded' task. This task is responsible for forwarding the debt collection process to Inkasso-DL.

5. The 'Regression possibility\nReport' event also triggers the 'Cash receipt\nNot applicable' task, which is related to the cash receipt process.

6. The 'Cash receipt\nNot applicable' task sends an 'ExclusiveGateway2' message, which leads to the 'Regression\nwith payment receipt\nclosed' task. This task closes the regression with payment receipt.

In summary, the 'Regression possibility\nReport' event initiates a series of tasks and gateways, leading to the closure of the 'Regression\nwith payment receipt\nclosed' task and the forwarding of the debt collection process to Inkasso-DL.
