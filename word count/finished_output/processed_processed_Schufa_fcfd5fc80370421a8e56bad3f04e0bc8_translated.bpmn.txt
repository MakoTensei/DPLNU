 When the StartEvent0 is triggered, it initiates a sequence of tasks and events. First, a Request scoring task is activated, which sends a Scoring request to the Scoring\nCreate Level1 gateway. This request is then forwarded to the forward delay task, which in turn sends an IntermediateCatchEvent2. The Scoring\nCreate Level1 gateway receives the Scoring request and sends a Result\ndetermined? message to the Scoring\nCreate Level2 gateway. The Scoring\nCreate Level2 gateway then sends a sid-69481BAB-CF5E-4A05-ABEE-CE0AF4479F47 to the forward delay task. Finally, the Bank scoring\nFinished and Scoring ends end events are triggered, marking the completion of the scoring process.
