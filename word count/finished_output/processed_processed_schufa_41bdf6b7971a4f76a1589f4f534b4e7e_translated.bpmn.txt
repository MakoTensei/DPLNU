 When a scoring request is initiated, it first reaches the ExclusiveGateway1, which then forwards the request to the Result there? gateway. The Result there? gateway checks if the scoring request can be processed and forwards it to the Level 1? gateway. The Level 1? gateway determines if Level 1 scoring can be performed and sends the request to ExclusiveGateway3. ExclusiveGateway3 then checks if Level 1 scoring is possible and, if so, proceeds to perform Level 2 scoring. Throughout this process, the system is waiting for an answer from the Result there? gateway. Once the scoring process is complete, the system reaches the EndEvent0 and EndEvent1, marking the completion of the scoring request.
