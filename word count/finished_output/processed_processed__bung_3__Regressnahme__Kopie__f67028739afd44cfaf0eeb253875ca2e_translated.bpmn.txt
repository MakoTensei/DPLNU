 In a system where various tasks and gateways interact, we have a series of events and processes that begin with the 'RESULTS' event and end with specific outcomes. The 'RESULTS' event triggers the 'WIDERESPRUCH TEST' task, which then leads to the 'EndEvent2' through the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway also connects to the 'GELD IST' task, which in turn leads to the 'GELD IST' event. The 'GELD IST' event is linked to the 'INCLUDED' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent3'.

Simultaneously, the 'RESULTS' event also initiates the 'INCLUDING' task, which is associated with the 'WOMAN' event. This task concludes with the 'EndEvent4'.

The 'REGRESS' gateway, on the other hand, receives 'RESULTS' and sends back 'kEIN rGERESS'. It also connects to the 'INCLUDED' task, which leads to the 'kEIN rGERESS' event.

In summary, the 'RESULTS' event sets off a chain of tasks and gateways, leading to various outcomes such as 'GELD IST', 'INCLUDED', and 'EndEvent4'. The 'REGRESS' gateway serves as a feedback mechanism, sending back 'kEIN rGERESS' to certain tasks.
