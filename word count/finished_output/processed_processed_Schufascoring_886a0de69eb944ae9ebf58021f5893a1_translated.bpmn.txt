 The process begins with the 'Loan infrastructure' start event, which triggers the 'Start Schufascoring' task. This task initiates the scoring process by receiving input from the loan infrastructure and directing the output to 'Scoring Level 1'. The 'Scoring Level 1' task then takes over, continuing to receive input from the loan infrastructure and passing its output to 'IntermediateCatchEvent0'. This event generates a 'Delay message' and sends the 'Find Final Scoring' task to the next stage. The 'Find Final Scoring' task, once again receiving input from the loan infrastructure, produces 'Scoring result Level 2' and 'Conclusion' as its outputs. The 'Conclusion' event signifies the end of the process, while 'Scoring result Level 2' is the final output of the scoring process.
