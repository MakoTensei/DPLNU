 Upon receiving an order intake, the process begins with checking the order quantity through the 'ParallelGateway6'. Concurrently, offers from three freight forwarders are picked up. Once the offers are received, they are routed to 'ExclusiveGateway1' for further processing.

Simultaneously, the need to check insurance is addressed by routing the order to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. After the insurance check, the order is forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway5', which then sends the order to 'ParallelGateway7' for completion.

As the order progresses, the goods are packaged and sent to 'ParallelGateway6'. The packaged goods are then routed to 'ParallelGateway7' for final completion.

The process concludes when the order is completed, with the final step being the routing of the completed order back to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
