 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph:

When a customer feels hungry, they trigger the "Hunger felt" event, which leads to the "Add your order" action. The customer then selects their meal from the menu and submits their order.

Once the order is received, the "Order obtained" event occurs, prompting the "Enable Pieper" action. This action activates the Pieper system, preparing it to cook the customer's meal.

After the cooking order is obtained, the "Cooking order obtained" event takes place, and the "inform employees" action is executed. The kitchen staff is informed about the order, and they start preparing the meal.

Once the meal is ready, the "Famine" event is triggered, indicating that the customer's hunger has been satisfied.

The "Food output" event follows, where the prepared meal is delivered to the customer.

Finally, the "Order completed" event signifies the successful completion of the order process, and the kitchen staff is informed about the completion.

In summary, the flow of events starts with the customer feeling hungry, leading to placing an order, activating the Pieper system, preparing the meal, delivering the food, and completing the order.
