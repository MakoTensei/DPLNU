Following this, the 'Packing goods' task commences, with 'ParallelGateway5' as its incoming gateway and 'Goods ready for collection' as its outgoing gateway.

As the goods are ready for collection, the 'Goods ready for collection' event is triggered, with 'Packing goods' as its incoming gateway. This marks the end of the process, with no outgoing gateways specified for this event.

Throughout this process, the 'ExclusiveGateway0' serves as the initial gateway, connecting to 'ParallelGateway5' for the 'Fill out standard package voucher' task. It also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' for the 'Clearing the insurance obligation' and 'Complete insurance' tasks, respectively.
