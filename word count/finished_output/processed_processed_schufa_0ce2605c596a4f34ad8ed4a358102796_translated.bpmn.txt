 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the 'Send Scoring Answers' task, which then triggers the 'Determining Scoring (Level1)' task. This task, identified by'sid-9FBE840B-915A-4EBE-B228-1BA482257643', takes the incoming 'StartEvent1' and leads to the 'Result?' gateway. The 'Result?' gateway, with the ID'sid-5FF073AE-E45A-4940-B758-4B052D121C75', then sends the incoming 'StartEvent0' to'sid-055E2D40-153A-494B-9BE3-CEEF20A339EB' and also sends 'Result a.' to the 'Waiting for answer' gateway,'sid-AD4DFAF5-E6F8-42E9-89BD-F3374E22DBB9'.

The 'Waiting for answer' gateway, upon receiving 'Result a.', triggers the 'Determining Scoring (Level2)' task, identified by'sid-148C5864-79A1-4933-A7A4-6633211F6E26'. This task takes the incoming 'Result is it?' from the 'Result?' gateway,'sid-3211F4A1-CB66-486F-B72D-11441249B36A', and sends the final 'Result send' to the 'EndEvent2' gateway,'sid-607EABCD-5780-4E33-BF34-487D08F434E5'. This marks the end of the process.
