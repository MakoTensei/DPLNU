 A shipment is necessary, triggering a series of tasks and gateways to ensure the delivery process. The shipment initiates the process at ParallelGateway4, which then connects to ExclusiveGateway1, offering three different transport options. The customer selects the necessary transport option, leading to ExclusiveGateway3, where the goods are packaged. The packaged goods are then sent to ParallelGateway7, where the insurance is completed. Finally, the goods are delivered, completing the process at Goods Delivered.

Here's a more natural flow description:
