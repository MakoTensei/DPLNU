 When a guest feels hungry, they trigger the "Hunger felt" event, which leads to the "Add your order" task. The guest then proceeds to the line, initiating the "Guest is in line" event.

As the guest waits in line, the "Piper has been triggered" event occurs, signaling that the meal is ready. This event connects to the "Pick up your order" task, which is then followed by the "Pick up your meal" task.

Once the meal is ready, the "Guest is here" event is triggered, and the guest is directed to the ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway connects to the "Food is ready" event, which sets a timer for 5 minutes before redirecting the guest back to ExclusiveGateway0.

During the 5-minute wait, the "Guest is in line" event continues to trigger, leading to the "Pick up your order" task. After the timer expires, the "Guest appears on the issue" event is triggered, which then leads to the "EndEvent1" task.

The "EndEvent1" task is connected to the EventBasedGateway1, which in turn connects to the "Deliver food" task, completing the process of delivering the food to the guest.

In summary, the guest's hunger triggers a series of events that lead to the preparation and delivery of their meal. The process involves tasks such as adding the order, picking up the meal, and delivering the food, all coordinated through various gateways and events.
