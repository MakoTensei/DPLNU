 The process begins with the 'Start Shipment' event, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task with incoming data from 'ParallelGateway3'. Once the goods are packaged, they are ready for collection, leading to the 'Goods ready for collection' task, which is initiated by 'ParallelGateway3' and concludes with 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, '3 offers' are generated from 'ParallelGateway3', and a choice is made by selecting a quote, which is facilitated by '1 Choose a quote xy' task. This task, in turn, sends the large quantity to 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'Filling the package note' task also sends a large quantity to 'InclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, the 'Insurance close' task, triggered by 'Insurance?' from 'ParallelGateway3', sends the large quantity to 'InclusiveGateway2' as well. All these tasks converge at 'InclusiveGateway2', which then sends the goods to 'EndEvent0'.
