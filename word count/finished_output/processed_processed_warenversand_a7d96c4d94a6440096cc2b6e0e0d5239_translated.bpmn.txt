 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the selection of an offer. This leads to the 'Select your offer' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'. Once the offer is selected, the 'Specialist' task is triggered, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Specialist' task is responsible for filling the package note, which is connected to the 'Filling the package note' task. This task is also connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'ParallelGateway7' is also connected to the 'Pick up a quote from the freight forwarder 2' and 'Pick up a quote from the forwarder 3' tasks. The 'Pick up a quote from the freight forwarder 2' task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway6', and the 'Pick up a quote from the forwarder 3' task is also connected to the 'ParallelGateway7'.

The 'ParallelGateway6' is connected to the 'Packaging goods' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' is connected to the 'Insurance close' task, which in turn connects to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process starts with the 'StartEvent0', leading to the selection of an offer, followed by the filling of the package note, picking up quotes from freight forwarders, packaging the goods, and finally closing the insurance. The process ends with the 'EndEvent0'.
