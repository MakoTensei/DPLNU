 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway5' to initiate the packaging of goods. This leads to the 'Packaging goods' task, which then sends a request to 'ParallelGateway4' for the goods to be ready for shipment. Concurrently, the 'ParallelGateway5' also sends a request to 'Request 3 forwarders' task to select a quote for the shipping process.

The 'Request 3 forwarders' task sends a request to 'Select a quote' task, which in turn sends a request to 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task then sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway1' for further processing.

Meanwhile, the 'Fill standardised parcel certificate' task sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway0' for filling the parcel certificate. The 'Insurance necessary?' task also sends a request to 'ExclusiveGateway0' to determine if insurance is necessary for the shipment.

If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Insurance necessary?' task sends a request to 'InclusiveGateway3' to handle the insurance process. The 'InclusiveGateway3' then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4' for final preparation before shipment.

Once all tasks are completed, the goods are ready for shipment, and the process ends with the'ready for shipment' event.
