 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Request Schufascoring' task, which sends a 'Feedback\nReport' to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task then forwards the scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'First Schufascoring\nperform' task, which sends a 'Feedback\nReport' to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then proceeds to 'forward delay' before reaching 'EndEvent1'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' also triggers the 'Report delay' task, which sends the scoring result to 'Second scoring\nperform' at 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Second scoring\nperform' task then sends the final scoring result to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which concludes the process with 'EndEvent1'.
