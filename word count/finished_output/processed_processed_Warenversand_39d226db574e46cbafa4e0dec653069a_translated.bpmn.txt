 When a shipment is initiated for a large crowd, the process begins with the 'Goods Ship' event, which triggers the 'Get Offert of 3 Spediteurs' task to select the most cost-effective shipping offers. Once the offers are chosen, the 'Specifies desired forwarders' task is executed, directing the shipment to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then connects to 'Insurance required?' to determine if insurance is necessary for the shipment. If insurance is required, the process proceeds to 'Closes insurance' at 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn leads to 'ParallelGateway5'. The goods are then packaged and prepared for collection at 'ParallelGateway4', and finally, the 'Goods delivered' event concludes the process, with the possibility of insurance being closed if it was initially required.
