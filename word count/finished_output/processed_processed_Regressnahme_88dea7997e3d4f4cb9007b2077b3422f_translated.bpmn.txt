 Upon receiving a 'Regression report', the system initiates a check for any regression issues. If a regression is detected, the process is redirected to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for further action. Concurrently, if the report suggests a possible re-submission, the system also sends a notification to 'Set on re-submission'.

If 'VN contradicts' the report, the system evaluates the contradiction and decides whether to proceed with 'Disclosure of debt collection' or to redirect to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

When 'Payment received?' is confirmed, the system checks if a re-submission is necessary. If so, it sends a notification to 'Set on re-submission' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

If the 'Reimbursement period expired', the system redirects to 'ExclusiveGateway3' for further processing.

The process concludes when 'Closed' is received, indicating that the 'Book the entrance' task has been completed.
