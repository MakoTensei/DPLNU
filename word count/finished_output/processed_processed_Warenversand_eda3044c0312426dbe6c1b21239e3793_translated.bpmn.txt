 When goods are dispatched, the process begins with selecting the shipping mode, which is handled by the 'Select shipping mode' task. This task takes the dispatched goods as input and directs them to 'ParallelGateway4'. From there, the 'Package tickets' task is triggered, requiring the type of shipping to be determined. This task sends the dispatched goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Simultaneously, the 'Offers enroll' task is initiated, asking for the type of shipping. This task sends the dispatched goods to 'Special offer Select' and directs the user to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Special offer Select' task then asks for the type of shipping and sends the dispatched goods to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the 'Insurance close' task is activated, asking if insurance is necessary. If the user confirms, the dispatched goods are sent to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Packing' task is triggered next, taking the dispatched goods from 'ParallelGateway4' and sending them to 'ParallelGateway5'. Finally, the 'Provide for collection' task is initiated, taking the dispatched goods from 'ParallelGateway5' and directing them to 'Pickup'.

In summary, the process starts with selecting the shipping mode, followed by determining the type of shipping, deciding on insurance, packing the goods, and finally providing for collection.
