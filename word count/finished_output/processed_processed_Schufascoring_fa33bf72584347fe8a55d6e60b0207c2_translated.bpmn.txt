 Upon receiving a 'Question Start' event, the system initiates a process to obtain a request. This process involves a 'Request Obtained' event, which triggers the 'Scoring (Level 1)' task, identified by the ID'sid-5F580350-41A4-4BEF-8B97-547C5CE997EC'. The task is designed to successfully score the obtained request. Once the scoring is completed, the system proceeds to the 'Scoring (Level 2)' task, identified by the ID'sid-7645187E-7C3F-476C-8259-5FE25F8A21CF', which further refines the scoring process.

The successful completion of the 'Scoring (Level 2)' task results in the 'Scoring Successful?' event, identified by the ID'sid-C977A30C-5F9D-4537-B89E-EF467D839EAD'. This event has two outgoing connections: one to the 'Answer Sufa Preserved' event, identified by the ID'sid-EBD870FB-F3BF-466A-8BDC-88AB52A2CEBE', and another to the 'Delay at Schufa Not Applicable' event, identified by the ID'sid-7805CAEC-5B71-45D0-963E-ACB2FCA20A7D'.

The 'Answer Sufa Preserved' event, triggered by the 'Scoring Successful?' event, has an incoming connection from the 'Scoring Successful?' event and an outgoing connection to the 'Delay at Schufa Not Applicable' event. This indicates that the successful scoring process leads to the preservation of the answer and the delay at Schufa is not applicable.

Finally, the system concludes the process with the 'End of Query' event, identified by the ID'sid-F4325381-4436-417F-89FC-BAB
