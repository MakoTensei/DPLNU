 Upon receiving an order, the logistics manager initiates the process by directing the order to be picked up from three freight forwarders. The Secretariat then checks the quantity of the order and determines whether it's a large or small amount. Based on this information, the Secretariat routes the order to either ExclusiveGateway1 or ExclusiveGateway2.

Simultaneously, the Secretariat also checks if the order is insured or standard delivery. This decision is made based on the quantity of the order. The Secretariat routes the order to either ParallelGateway5 or ExclusiveGateway1, depending on the insurance status.

The warehouse workers then package the goods, and the packaged goods are sent to ParallelGateway5. At this point, the Secretariat checks the insurance status again and routes the order to either ExclusiveGateway2 or ParallelGateway5.

The order is then sent to ExclusiveGateway2, where the customer selects their offer. The offer selection is based on the quantity of the order, which is either large or small.

Finally, the order is forwarded to ParallelGateway5, where the goods are sent to the customer.
