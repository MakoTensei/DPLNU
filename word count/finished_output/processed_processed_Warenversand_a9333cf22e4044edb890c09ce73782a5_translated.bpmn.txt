 The process begins with a 'Shipping order' event, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways.

1. The 'Shipping order' event initiates the process and sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
2. 'ExclusiveGateway1' checks if the order is a 'Big amount?' and, if so, sends it to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
3. 'ParallelGateway5' sends the order to 'ParallelGateway6' and 'Special offer'.
4. 'ParallelGateway6' sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway1' checks if the order requires 'Insurance' and, if so, sends it to 'Insurance required?' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
6. 'Insurance required?' sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'Order ready for dispatch'.
7. 'ExclusiveGateway3' checks if the order requires 'Insurance' and, if so, sends it to 'ParallelGateway7'.
8. 'ParallelGateway7' sends the order to 'Order ready for dispatch'.

The process concludes when the 'Order ready for dispatch' event is triggered, indicating that the order has been processed and is ready to be shipped.
