 In a seamless flow of tasks and gateways, the process begins with the 'VN in Regress take' event, which triggers the 'Send payment request' task. This task then connects to the 'Check Regress Claim' task, which in turn leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' is a critical junction that forwards the 'Check Regress Claim' task to the 'Reasons\nRight?' gateway, which also receives the 'Money\nReport' task.

The 'Reasons\nRight?' gateway further directs the 'Check Regress Claim' task to the 'ExclusiveGateway4', while also receiving the 'Claim\nis there?' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway4' then sends the 'Claim\nis there?' task to the 'EndEvent1', and also receives the 'Reimbursement case' task.

Meanwhile, the 'Check Regress Claim' task also connects to the 'Book money receipt' task, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then sends the 'Check Regress Claim' task to the 'Process\nclosed' event, which is the final stage of the process.
