 When a customer obtains an order, the process begins with the 'Order Obtained' event, which triggers the '3 Offers' task. The customer is then presented with a selection of offers, leading to the 'Select Your Offer' task. Depending on the chosen offer, the customer is directed to a specialist through the 'Specialist' task. If the selected offer requires insurance, the 'Complete Insurance' task is initiated. Once the offer is finalized, the 'Complete Standard Package Ticket' task is executed.

Parallel to this, the 'Type of Shipping?' task is triggered, which diverges into two paths: 'ExclusiveGateway3' for shipping options and 'ExclusiveGateway2' for insurance and standard package options. The customer's choice leads to the appropriate gateways.

For the 'ExclusiveGateway2' path, the customer can either proceed with the 'Complete Standard Package Ticket' or opt for insurance, which leads to the 'Complete Insurance' task.

The 'ParallelGateway4' task is initiated when the customer selects an offer, and it leads to either 'ParallelGateway5' for shipping or '3 Offers' for additional options.

Finally, the 'ParallelGateway5' task is triggered for shipping, and the 'Delivering Goods' task is initiated, which concludes the process with the 'Goods Made Available' event.
