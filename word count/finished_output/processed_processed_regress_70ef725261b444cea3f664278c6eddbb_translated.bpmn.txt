 When a regression case is identified, the process begins with the task of sending a payment request to address the issue. This task is triggered by the 'Regression' event and leads to the 'Send payment request' task.

Once the payment request is sent, the case is set for re-submission, which is the next step in the process. This task is initiated by the 'Send payment request' task and results in the 'Set case for re-submission' task.

Following the re-submission, the case is reviewed to determine if the opposition's arguments are justified. This decision is made by the 'Set case for re-submission' task, which triggers the 'Opposition\njustified?' event. If the opposition's arguments are justified, the case is closed, and a booking for money receipt is made. This sequence of events is represented by the 'Opposition\njustified?' event and the 'Book money receipt' task.

If the opposition's arguments are not justified, the case is closed, and the process ends. This sequence of events is represented by the 'Opposition\njustified?' event and the 'Case closed' task.

In the case where the reimbursement period has expired, the case is transferred to debt collection. This event is triggered by the 'Set case for re-submission' task and leads to the 'Transfer order to debt collection' task.

Overall, the process starts with a regression case, followed by payment request, re-submission, and evaluation of the opposition's arguments. Depending on the outcome, the case may be closed or transferred to debt collection.
