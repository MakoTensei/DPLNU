 The task 'perform scoring level 1' initiates with the 'StartEvent1' and is designed to produce a 'Scoring result available?' outcome. This result is then passed to the 'Sufa\nResult\navailable?' gateway, which has incoming connections from 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. This gateway subsequently forwards the result to two other tasks,'sid-5B030B21-1860-4F3A-BEE3-53AC3A28ED6C' and'sid-67B6F62D-72E3-4C32-8CD7-21C5BB792EC2'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway itself receives input from'sid-071EEE93-58AD-4895-86BF-4888F20AFDED'. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent1', which receives the results from'sid-AC02AA12-C38A-4717-8776-33D22586FC2D' and'sid-285DB880-984E-4CB1-B509-9AA98FA2B73E'.
