 In a bustling city, a restaurant named "Court of Justice" welcomes patrons with a unique dining experience. As guests enter, they are greeted by the nameplate "Restaurant\nentering" and are directed to the "Court of Justice\nSelect" for their meal selection.

Upon deciding on their orders, the guests are prompted to provide their "Order\nDate" to initiate the process. The "EventBasedGateway0" receives the order date and sends the guests to either "Guest stands for\nIssue" or "5 minutes\npast," depending on the time required for their order.

As the guests wait, the kitchen staff prepares their meals. Once the orders are ready, the "Pieper\npiept" event is triggered, signaling the kitchen to deliver the meals. The guests are then directed to the "Court of Justice\naccepted" event, where they receive their delicious meals.

After enjoying their meals, the guests are given the option to "Order\nDate" again for any additional orders or to proceed to the "Court of Justice\nMission." The "EventBasedGateway1" receives the order date and directs the guests to either "Guest stands for\nIssue" or "5 minutes\npast," depending on the time required for their new orders.

Meanwhile, the "Court of Justice\nRetrieve guest" event is activated, and the staff retrieves the guests to inform them about the next steps in their dining experience. The guests are then directed to the "Court of Justice\nhand over" event, where they are prepared for their next course.

Throughout the dining experience, the "Court of Justice\nMission" event ensures that all guests are informed about the restaurant's mission and values, creating a memorable and enjoyable dining experience for all.
