 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped' (sid-0AA5FD02-8736-46B6-B49F-47905DDAED46), which triggers the 'Provide goods for collection' task (sid-77143DC4-D9D0-4C12-85D1-CADD6CC9A104). This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5' (sid-A6FD941A-315D-4405-BFB5-C4D487B0AFD8) for incoming and 'ParallelGateway4' (sid-47190FE8-48CE-450F-957E-562491A5B90A) for outgoing.

Next, the 'Pick up the offer of three freight forwarders' task (sid-FD363CBE-9171-413B-9667-6BDFB81CBD58) is initiated, which also relies on 'ParallelGateway5' (sid-A6FD941A-315D-4405-BFB5-C4D487B0AFD8) for incoming and leads to 'Select your offer' (sid-C18DFD8A-E3A7-4FC7-8E02-633ADC765352) via 'ExclusiveGateway0' (sid-16656E0F-12D7-45E4-82DC-984C56E9ADCE).

The 'Select your offer' task (sid-C18DFD8A-E3A7-4FC7-8E02-633ADC76532) then connects to 'Specialist' (sid-87CAD474-9E4A-4F5B-89EC-14EB14C7
