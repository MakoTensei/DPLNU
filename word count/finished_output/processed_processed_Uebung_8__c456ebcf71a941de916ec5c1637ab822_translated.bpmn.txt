 Let's rephrase the given tasks into a more natural and conversational flow, integrating the details from the gateways and events:

1. When a customer expresses hunger, initiate the process to access a restaurant.
2. Upon accessing the restaurant, present the customer with a selection of meals.
3. Once the customer selects a meal, proceed to process the payment for the chosen meal.
4. After payment is received, serve the customer their meal.
5. When the meal is served, the customer's satisfaction is recorded, and they are ready to leave.

Now, let's integrate the gateways and events into this flow:

1. A customer expresses hunger, triggering the event 'Hunger\nNot applicable' (ID: sid-053B0DF5-5D81-40D6-9748-E382FAEEB927). This event leads to the 'Order of meal' task (ID: sid-73E04115-21F6-4C52-8D50-03809DD8F18A).
2. The 'Order of meal' task (ID: sid-73E04115-21F6-4C52-8D50-03809DD8F18A) sends an incoming message to the 'Record\nnew order' gateway (ID: sid-A15675D8-5C4D-458A-8AC3-1F7995AAB96A).
3. The 'Record\nnew order' gateway (ID: sid-A15675D8-5C4D-458A-8AC3-1F7995AAB96A) triggers the 'Selection of meal' task (ID: sid-BBD6E46E-709C-480A-957E-1F7995AAB96A).
4. The 'Selection of meal' task (ID: sid-BBD6E46E-709C-4
