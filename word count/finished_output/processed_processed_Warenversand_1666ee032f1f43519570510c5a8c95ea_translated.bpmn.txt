 The postal mail process begins at ExclusiveGateway0, which receives incoming traffic from ParallelGateway6. From there, it proceeds to Filling the package note, which then sends outgoing traffic to ExclusiveGateway4. This gateway, in turn, connects to ExclusiveGateway5, which is responsible for routing to ParallelGateway7.

Special delivery, on the other hand, starts at ExclusiveGateway1, which receives traffic from ExclusiveGateway0. It then sends outgoing traffic to ExclusiveGateway2, ExclusiveGateway2, and ParallelGateway7.

The process of packaging goods begins at ParallelGateway7, which receives traffic from ExclusiveGateway1 and ExclusiveGateway2. The package is then picked up at EndEvent0, which receives traffic from ParallelGateway7.

In summary, the postal mail and special delivery processes are interconnected through ExclusiveGateway0 and ExclusiveGateway1, with the former leading to Filling the package note and the latter to Spediteur selection. The Spediteur selection process involves multiple gateways, including ExclusiveGateway2 and ParallelGateway7, which are also part of the complete insurance and package pickup processes.
