 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the packaging process. The 'Explanation' task is triggered, which leads to the 'InclusiveGateway2'. This gateway connects to the 'Filling the package note' task, which in turn prompts the 'Insurance required?' question. If insurance is needed, the process moves to 'Complete insurance' through 'InclusiveGateway4'. If not, it proceeds to the 'Specialist' task via 'InclusiveGateway3'. The 'Specialist' task concludes the process at 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, the 'Pick up offers' task is also connected to 'InclusiveGateway2', leading to the 'Packaging' task. The 'Packaging' task can be initiated directly from 'StartEvent0' or after the 'Filling the package note' task, and it also leads to 'EndEvent0' through 'InclusiveGateway3'.
