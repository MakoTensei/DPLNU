 The shipping process begins with the 'Goods\nShip\n' start event, which triggers the 'Special delivery' task, utilizing the 'ExclusiveGateway0' to route the process. The 'Special delivery' task then leads to the 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn connects to the 'EndEvent0' end event. Concurrently, the 'Goods\nShip\n' start event also initiates the 'Filling the package note' task, which uses 'ExclusiveGateway0' to proceed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task then connects to 'ParallelGateway5', which finally links to the 'EndEvent0' end event. Additionally, the 'Goods\nShip\n' start event also triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which uses 'ParallelGateway4' to reach 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'Packaging goods' task is followed by the 'Goods for collection' task, which uses 'ParallelGateway5' to reach the 'EndEvent0' end event. Lastly, the 'Commodity insurance' task, initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway2', connects to 'ParallelGateway5' and 'EndEvent0'.
