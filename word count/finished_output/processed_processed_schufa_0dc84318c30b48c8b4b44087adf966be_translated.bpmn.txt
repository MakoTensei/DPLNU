 In the scoring process, a series of events and gateways are triggered to ensure the accurate and timely delivery of scoring results. It all starts with a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which initiates the process by sending a message to the 'Message to Frontend' gateway. This gateway is responsible for communicating the need for scoring to the frontend system.

Next, a 'Scoring request\nmade available' event is triggered, which sends a message to the 'Result Level 1 Report to Bank' gateway. This gateway is responsible for reporting the initial scoring results to the bank.

As the scoring process continues, the 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Scoring\nRequired' event and forwards it to the 'Scoring result\nthe' gateway. This gateway is responsible for generating the scoring result message.

Meanwhile, the 'Schufa delays' event is triggered, which sends a message to the 'InclusiveGateway2'. This gateway handles the delay caused by Schufa and forwards the event to the 'Scoring result\nthe' gateway.

The 'InclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Schufa delays' event and the 'EventBasedGateway1' event, and it sends the 'Scoring result\nthe' message to the frontend system.

Finally, the 'Scoring result\nthe' event is completed, and the scoring results are delivered to the frontend system.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of events and gateways that work together to ensure the accurate and timely delivery of scoring results. The process starts with a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, followed by a 'Scoring request\nmade available' event, and ends with the 'Scoring result\nthe' event. The 'Message to Frontend' and 'Result Level 1 Report to Bank' gateways play crucial roles in communicating the need for scoring and reporting the initial results, respectively. The 'EventBasedGateway1' and 'InclusiveGateway2' gateways handle the event flow and ensure the smooth delivery of the scoring results.
