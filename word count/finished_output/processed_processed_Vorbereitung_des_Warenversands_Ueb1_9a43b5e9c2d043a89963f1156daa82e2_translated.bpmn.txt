 The process begins with the event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. This task is connected to 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn leads to 'Check quantity'. The 'Check quantity' task is linked to 'ParallelGateway3' again, and then to 'Get three offers from forwarders'. The 'Get three offers from forwarders' task connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which then leads to 'Complete insurance'.

The 'Complete insurance' task has an incoming link from 'ParallelGateway4' and an outgoing link to 'ParallelGateway4'. This task is followed by 'Provide goods for collection', which is connected to 'ParallelGateway4' and subsequently to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task has an incoming link from 'large amount?' and an outgoing link to 'End'.

Meanwhile, the 'large amount?' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ParallelGateway3' task leads to 'Provide goods for collection', which is connected to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'Provide goods for collection' task is then followed by 'End'.

In summary, the process starts with 'Goods are to be shipped', leading to 'Packaging goods', then 'Check quantity', followed by 'Get three offers from forwarders', 'Complete insurance', 'Provide goods for collection', and finally 'End'. The 'large amount?' task is also involved in the process, connecting to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2', which both lead to 'End'.
