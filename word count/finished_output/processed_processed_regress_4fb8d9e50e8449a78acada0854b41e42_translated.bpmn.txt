 The process begins with the event 'VN can be taken in regress', which triggers the 'Regress possibility exists?' gateway. This gateway then leads to the 'Check the case' task, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Meanwhile, the 'Set process for resubmission' task is initiated, which sends incoming payments to the 'Book incoming payment' task. This task also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'EventBasedGateway3' event triggers the 'Rejection of payment justified?' gateway, which leads to the 'Rejection of payment justified?' task. This task connects to the 'Close' task, which is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway3' event. The 'Reimbursement deadline expired?' gateway is also triggered by 'EventBasedGateway3', leading to the 'Reimbursement deadline expired?' task. The process concludes with the 'Case edited' task, which receives incoming payments and has no outgoing connections.
