 In the scoring process, the system starts with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up Schufascoring' task. This task is then followed by the 'Scoring determined' event, which connects to the 'Scoring result available' event. The 'Scoring result available' event leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', where the 'Results available?' event is received. This event connects to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which in turn connects to the 'Level 2 Scoring' task. The 'Level 2 Scoring' task is then followed by the 'Scoring determined' event, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' again. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then leads to the 'Scoringer gibis delayed' task, which connects to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' then connects back to the 'StartEvent0', completing the scoring process.
