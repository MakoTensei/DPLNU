 In the scoring process, the workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'forward scoring results' task. This task then leads to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent0', which eventually results in the 'End' event.

Simultaneously, the 'Report delay' task is initiated by 'IntermediateCatchEvent0'. This task is followed by 'IntermediateCatchEvent1', which also concludes with the 'End' event.

Meanwhile, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Report Scoring Results' task, which is followed by 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. This task concludes with the 'Report the scoring result' task, which finally ends with the 'End' event.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to 'forward scoring results' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent0'. The 'Report delay' task is triggered by 'IntermediateCatchEvent0' and concludes with 'End'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' initiates 'Report Scoring Results', followed by 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'Report the scoring result', both concluding with 'End'.
