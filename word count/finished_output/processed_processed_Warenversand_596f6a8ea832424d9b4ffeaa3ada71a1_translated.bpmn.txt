 When a shipment is received, the process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. This task is responsible for selecting the appropriate offer for the goods. Once an offer is selected, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, which requires a note to be filled for the package. This task is connected to the 'big crowd?' event, indicating that the package may be part of a larger shipment.

The 'Filling the package note' task then sends the package to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn connects to the 'Pick up offers' task, creating a loop until the offer is selected. After the offer is selected, the 'Select your offer' task is triggered, which also requires the 'big crowd?' event. The selected offer is then sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which provides collection services for the package.

Simultaneously, the 'Select your offer' task also triggers the 'Complete insurance' task, which requires the 'Insurance necessary?' event. The 'Complete insurance' task sends the package to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which connects to the 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' then sends the package to the 'provided for collection' endpoint, completing the process.

In summary, the process starts with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task. The selected offer leads to the 'Filling the package note' task, which connects to the 'big crowd?' event. The 'Select your offer' task then triggers the 'Complete insurance' task, which connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Finally, the 'ParallelGateway5' sends the package to the 'provided for collection' endpoint, completing the process.
