 In a workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up Schufascoring' task, which then proceeds to the 'ParallelGateway1'. Once the 'ParallelGateway1' completes its operation, it leads to the 'Execution of other work' task. This task, in turn, connects to the 'StartEvent1', initiating the 'Implementation 1. scoring' process.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' also triggers the 'Entering delay' task, which then leads to the 'Implementation 2. Scoring' process. The 'Implementation 2. Scoring' task communicates the scoring value to the 'Results determined?' gateway, which then connects to the 'Communication of scoring value' task.

Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway1' also connects to the 'Completion of work' task, which is triggered by the 'Score result obtained' task. The 'Completion of work' task then leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the workflow starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to 'Pick up Schufascoring' and 'ParallelGateway1'. The 'ParallelGateway1' connects to 'Execution of other work' and 'EndEvent0'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' leads to 'Entering delay', 'Implementation 1. scoring', and 'Implementation 2. Scoring'. The 'Implementation 2. Scoring' task connects to 'Communication of scoring value', which then connects to 'Communication of the Scring Value'. The 'Score result obtained' task connects to 'Completion of work', which in turn leads to 'EndEvent0'.
