 The process begins with the 'Goods for shipping' start event, which triggers the 'Select offers' task (sid-7DB62C9D-6220-4D7E-A3C3-F60632732703) that requires incoming goods for shipping and sends outgoing traffic to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Pick up offers' task (sid-F52566A4-5D65-4E25-8A35-CDB58EEB55C9) then comes into play, with two conditions for quantity, and sends traffic to 'Select the Spediteur'. The 'Select the Spediteur' task (sid-09E79E78-448B-4DE0-9234-150A756D7FEC) requires incoming goods for shipping and sends outgoing traffic to 'ParallelGateway3'. The 'Insurance close' task (sid-0AB1216A-F05E-4042-A361-6ABC3A5C49B4) and 'packaging' task (sid-D01A942B-2E94-4D9C-B3F7-5E1CB3C84F50) both require incoming traffic from 'ParallelGateway2' and send outgoing traffic to 'ParallelGateway3'. Finally, the 'Pickup' task (sid-02E0B958-0566-4C48-8188-8E1985E0A599) requires incoming goods for shipping and sends outgoing traffic to 'EndEvent0'. The 'EndEvent0' (sid-2A4FC017-C041-4B00-9957-707EAD10917A) requires incoming traffic from 'ParallelGateway3' and has no outgoing traffic.
