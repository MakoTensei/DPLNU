 The feedback frontend, identified by the unique ID'sid-3F5E9242-F882-4580-A379-F4C5F31EA0EB', receives input from the ParallelGateway2, as indicated by the incoming connection. This frontend is responsible for processing feedback and is connected to the 'perform scoring' task, which is triggered by the 'StartEvent1' and concludes with 'EndEvent0'. The 'perform scoring' task, with the ID'sid-9C895B44-606E-442C-9985-923CBCEB9ED5', initiates the scoring process and sends an output to 'EndEvent0'.

The scoring process is further divided into two levels, with the first level being delayed by the 'Delay' task, identified by the ID'sid-90F8215B-31A3-4E39-AA91-1A58E1831124'. This task is triggered by the ParallelGateway2 and sends its output to 'Scoring Level 2', which is connected to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Scoring Level 2' task, with the ID'sid-C2491EBA-BEC5-4F75-86D5-4F3962D5C4D2', is responsible for the second level of scoring and is triggered by the 'Delay' task.

The scoring process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' start event, identified by the ID'sid-D50ADB69-D129-4051-823F-99D8F4B5F606', which initiates the 'perform scoring' task. The 'perform scoring' task is then connected to the 'Feedback Frontend' through the ParallelGateway2, as indicated by the incoming connection. The 'Feedback Frontend' is also connected to the 'Results type?' gateway, identified by the ID'sid-DA3462C5-657D-49B2-B9EB-E99
