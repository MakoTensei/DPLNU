 The process begins with the 'Schufascoring\nenroll' event, which triggers the 'Start your search' task, leading to the 'Level 1 Scoring' task. The 'Scoring\nperform' event then initiates the 'Scoring?' gateway, which in turn determines 'Level 1' and sends a 'Level 1\ndetermined' message. Concurrently, the 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway processes the 'Schufascoring\nenroll' event, delaying the information obtained and generating a 'Level 1\nReport'.

Following this, the 'Level 1\nobtained' message triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' task, which then leads to the 'Level 2 Scoring' task. The 'Scoring?' gateway receives the 'Scoring\nperform' event and determines 'Level 2', sending a 'Level 2\ndetermined' message. The 'Level 2\nobtained' message then triggers the 'Level 2 Scoring' task, which ultimately results in the 'Level 2\nReport' event.

In summary, the process involves a series of tasks, gateways, and events that work together to determine the scoring levels and generate corresponding reports. The 'Schufascoring\nenroll' event initiates the process, while the 'Level 2\nReport' event signifies the completion of the scoring process.
