 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and conversational way, fitting them into a cohesive story:

1. The customer feels hungry and decides to visit a restaurant.
2. Upon arrival, the customer chooses a table and is prompted to select their meal.
3. The customer selects their desired meal and places an order.
4. The order is processed, and the customer is informed that their meal will be ready in 5 minutes.
5. The kitchen starts preparing the meal, and the customer is notified that the cooking process has begun.
6. Once the meal is ready, the kitchen staff informs the employees about the completion of the cooking order.
7. The customer is notified that their meal is ready and is served.
8. After enjoying the meal, the customer publishes a guest review, signaling the end of their dining experience.

In this flow, the following events and gateways are involved:

- Start Events:
  - Event 1: "Hunger felt" triggers the customer to visit the restaurant and place an order.
  - Event 2: "Order to receive" prompts the restaurant to retrieve the customer's order.
  - Event 3: "Cooking order" initiates the meal preparation process.

- Gateways:
  - Gateway 1: "EventBasedGateway0" processes the completion message and updates the customer's status to "Ordered."
  - Gateway 2: "in the row" informs the kitchen staff that the customer is ready to receive their meal.
  - Gateway 3: "inform employees" notifies the kitchen staff that the cooking order has been processed.

- End Events:
  - Event 4: "Famine" indicates that the customer has finished their meal and is no longer hungry.
  - Event 5: "Ordered" confirms that the customer has received their meal.
  - Event 6: "Cooking order processed" signifies that the meal preparation is complete.
