 In the scoring process, a scoring request is obtained, triggering a series of events and interactions between various components. The process begins with the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event, which initiates the scoring process.

The first step is to perform scoring level 1, which is handled by the 'perform scoring level 1' task. This task is triggered by the 'StartEvent1' and once completed, it leads to an exception check. If an exception occurs, the process is directed to the 'An exception occurred?' gateway, which then ends the process with 'EndEvent1'.

If no exception occurs, the process continues to the 'InclusiveGateway2' task, which triggers the 'Trigger Schufa request' event. This event is responsible for requesting the Schufa data, which is essential for the scoring process. The 'Trigger Schufa request' event is also connected to the 'Delay registration\nobtained' event, which can cause a delay in the process.

Once the Schufa data is obtained, the process moves to the 'Get Schufa response' task, which is triggered by the 'InclusiveGateway2' task. This task retrieves the Schufa data and sends it to the 'EndEvent0' gateway, which concludes the scoring process at this level.

After obtaining the Schufa data, the process proceeds to perform scoring level 2. This task is triggered by the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which is connected to the 'StartEvent1' event. The 'perform scoring level 2' task is also connected to the 'Delay occurred?' gateway, which can cause a delay in the process.

Once scoring level 2 is completed, the process moves to the 'InclusiveGateway3' task, which triggers the 'InclusiveGateway5' event. This event is responsible for finalizing the scoring process and sending the final scoring result.

In summary, the scoring process starts with the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event, followed by performing scoring level 1 and level 2. The process involves various tasks, gateways, and events, with potential delays and exception handling along the way. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' gateway, which finalizes the scoring
