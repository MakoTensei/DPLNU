 In a system designed to handle scoring requests and results, the following sequence of events and interactions takes place:

1. The process begins with the 'Scoring\nRequired' start event, which triggers the forwarding of a 'Scoring request' to the 'EventBasedGateway0'. This gateway then sends the 'Scoring request' to the 'perform scoring\n(level 1)' service, which performs the initial scoring and sends the result to the 'EndEvent2'.

2. Concurrently, the 'EventBasedGateway0' also sends the 'Scoring request' to the 'forward scoring result to Frontend' service, which forwards the 'Scoring result' to the 'EndEvent0'.

3. The 'Entrance\nScoring request' start event initiates the process by sending the 'Scoring request' to the 'perform scoring\n(level 1)' service, which performs the initial scoring and sends the result to the 'EndEvent2'.

4. The 'EventBasedGateway0' also receives the 'Scoring request' from the 'Entrance\nScoring request' start event and forwards it to the 'forward scoring result to Frontend' service, which sends the 'Scoring result' to the 'EndEvent0'.

5. If a 'Scoring\nRequired' event is received, the 'EventBasedGateway0' forwards it to the 'perform scoring\n(level 1)' service, which performs the initial scoring and sends the result to the 'EndEvent2'.

6. If a 'Scoring\nRequired' event is received, the 'EventBasedGateway0' also forwards it to the 'forward scoring result to Frontend' service, which sends the 'Scoring result' to the 'EndEvent0'.

7. In case of a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, the 'EventBasedGateway0' also forwards it to the 'Delay message\nReport' service, which sends a delay message to the 'EndEvent0'.

8. The 'perform scoring\n(level 2)' service receives a 'Send delay message' event and performs the second level of scoring
