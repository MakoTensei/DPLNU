 In a seamless workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the 'Pick up Schufascoring' task, which then triggers a 'Message' to be sent. This message is received by the 'Message?' gateway, leading to a 'Message delayed' event. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent1' commences the 'Scoring request' task, resulting in an 'Immediately measurable?' event. The 'Scoring Level 2' task is triggered by the'sid-682E3987-21CE-425D-9D70-51CEF9ED7E3C' incoming event, and upon completion, it triggers the 'EndEvent1' event. Meanwhile, the 'Message' event from 'StartEvent0' reaches the 'Message?' gateway, causing it to send a 'Message delayed' event and also triggering the 'EndEvent0'. Finally, the 'Scoring request' task concludes with an 'Immediately measurable?' event, which in turn triggers the 'EndEvent1' event.
