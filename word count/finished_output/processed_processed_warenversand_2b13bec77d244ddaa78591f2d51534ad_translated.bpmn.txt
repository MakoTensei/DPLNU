 Starting with an 'Order' event, the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Order' event triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway6'.
2. Concurrently, the 'Order' event also triggers the 'Filling the package note' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
3. The 'Filling the package note' task then leads to the 'Insurance\nnecessary?' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
4. The 'Insurance\nnecessary?' task results in the 'Insurance\nclose' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.
5. The 'Insurance\nclose' task is linked to 'ParallelGateway6', which in turn connects to 'Goods\nready for collection'.
6. Meanwhile, the 'Packaging goods' task also leads to the 'Goods\nprovide' task, which is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
7. The 'Goods\nprovide' task is linked to 'Goods\nready for collection'.

Simultaneously, the 'Order' event also triggers the 'Special offer\nSelect' task, which is connected to 'ParallelGateway7'.

1. The 'Special offer\nSelect' task connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' twice.
2. The first connection to 'ExclusiveGateway2' leads to 'Goods\nready for collection'.
3. The second connection to 'ExclusiveGateway2' leads to 'Decision\nType of transport'.
4. The 'Decision\nType of transport' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway4'.
5. 'ParallelGateway4' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
6. 'ExclusiveGateway3' connects to 'Goods\nready for collection'.
