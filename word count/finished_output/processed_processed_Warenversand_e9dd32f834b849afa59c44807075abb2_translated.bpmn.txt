 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the selection of a spediteur. From the available spediteurs, the user selects 'Spediteur 1' and the system proceeds to pick a quote from them. Once the quote is selected, the process moves to the 'ExclusiveGateway5' where the freight forwarder's commission is calculated. After the commission is determined, the package note is filled, and the goods are prepared for collection. The 'EndEvent0' signifies the completion of the process, with the goods ready for collection.

Here's the flow of the process:

1. StartEvent0 initiates the process.
2. The user selects 'Spediteur 1' from the available spediteurs.
3. A quote is picked from 'Spediteur 1' and sent to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
4. The freight forwarder's commission is calculated at 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
5. The package note is filled at 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
6. The goods are prepared for collection at 'ExclusiveGateway5'.
7. The process concludes with 'EndEvent0', indicating that the goods are ready for collection.
