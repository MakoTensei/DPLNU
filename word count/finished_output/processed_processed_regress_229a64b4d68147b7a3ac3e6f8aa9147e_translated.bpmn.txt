 A report comes in with a regressive thought, triggering the 'Regress possible' gateway. This leads to the 'Open' state, where the case is checked. Upon review, the case is deemed regressive, and the process is set to 'WV' due to the regressive thought. The 'WV due' gateway is then activated, which opens the 'Set process to WV' gateway. The process is then set to 'WV', and the 'Opposition obtained' event occurs, closing the case.

Meanwhile, the 'EventBasedGateway3' is also triggered by the regressive thought, leading to the 'Open' state. The case is forwarded to the 'forward process to collection' gateway, which opens the 'Open' state. The 'Cash in' event occurs, closing the case and completing the process.

In summary, the regressive thought leads to the opening of two cases: one set to 'WV' and the other forwarded to the collection process. Both cases are closed after the respective events occur.
