The flow of the restaurant visit process starts with the customer feeling hunger fixed, leading them to visit the restaurant. At the restaurant, the customer selects a meal, which triggers the process of adding their order. The customer then proceeds to the cashier to pay for the meal. After payment, the customer is on the line, and the cashier accepts the payment, marking the end of Event0.

Next, the customer goes to the food preparation area, and the order is processed by the kitchen staff. Once the food is ready, it is handed over to the customer, marking the end of Event0 again. The customer receives their food and is ready to leave the restaurant.

Before leaving, the customer is informed by the staff that their food is ready. The customer then retrieves their food, and the process of serving the food is completed. The staff informs other employees about the food being provided.

As the customer is on the line, the Pieper (a system or process) is triggered, which leads to the EventBasedGateway0. This gateway processes the event and completes the overall process, ensuring that the customer's order is fulfilled and the restaurant's operations are streamlined.
