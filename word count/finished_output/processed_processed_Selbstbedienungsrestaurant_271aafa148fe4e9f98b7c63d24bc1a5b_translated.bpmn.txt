 Let's rephrase the given tasks and connections into a cohesive flow description:

1. Start with an event where a user experiences hunger, triggering the selection of a pieper (a placeholder for a food item).

2. The user then proceeds to the ordering process, where they select their desired pieper and submit their order.

3. The order is processed, and a confirmation is sent back to the user, indicating that their order has been received.

4. The pieper is picked up from the kitchen and prepared.

5. The prepared pieper is then delivered to the user.

6. Upon receiving the pieper, the user's hunger is satisfied, and they no longer feel famished.

7. The order completion event is triggered, and the system sends an output confirming the order fulfillment.

8. The process concludes with the user's hunger being addressed, and the order is successfully completed.


Gateways involved in this process:

- EventBasedGateway0: This gateway handles events related to order reporting and time-based triggers. It receives an 'Order\nReport' and a '5 minutes' event, and it sends an 'EventBasedGateway0' and 'Order\noutput' events in response.

- Pieper triggered\nor called out: This gateway is activated when the user's hunger is addressed, and it leads to the 'Famine' event, signaling the end of the user's hunger.

- Order issued: This gateway is triggered when the pieper is picked up from the kitchen and processed. It sends an 'Order issued' event.

- Order\noutput: This gateway is activated when the pieper is delivered to the user, confirming the completion of the order. It sends an 'Order\noutput' event.


Start Events:

- Hunger\nNot applicable: The user experiences hunger, initiating the process.

- Order\nReport: The user submits their order, triggering the order processing.

- Providing meal: The pieper is prepared and ready for delivery.


End Events:

- Famine: The user's hunger is satisfied,
