 Let's start with the event of hunger, which triggers the process of selecting a meal:

1. Hunger: The guest feels hungry and wants to order food.
2. Get Pieper: The system triggers the event to get Pieper, who will assist in the meal selection process.
3. Order to receive: The guest enters their order, which is then processed by the system.

Next, the system processes the order and prepares the meal:

4. Handling meal: The system handles the meal preparation, ensuring that the guest's order is fulfilled.
5. Providing meal: The prepared meal is provided to the guest.

Finally, the guest receives the meal and reports back to the system:

6. Meal ready for pick-up: The meal is ready and handed out to the guest.
7. Milling time handed out: The guest is informed about the pick-up time for their meal.
8. Guest reports: The guest reports back to the system, indicating that they have received their meal.

The system then completes the process, ensuring that the guest's hunger has been satisfied.
