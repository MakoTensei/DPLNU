 The process begins with the 'Potential Regression Report' which triggers the 'Check Regression Case' task. This task then sends a 'Payment Request' to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the 'Payment Request' is justified, it leads to the 'Regression Procedure Completed' task, which in turn closes the process.

Alternatively, if the 'Payment Request' is not justified, the 'Again Template Date Set' task is triggered, which sends a 'Payment Report' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task can also be triggered by an 'Opposition Report', which also sends the 'Payment Report' to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Meanwhile, the 'Regression Possible?' task checks for a 'Potential Regression Report' and sends a 'Payment Refusal Justified?' to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the refusal is justified, it leads to the 'Debt Collection Process Service Provider' task, which sends a 'Regression Procedure Completed' task to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Opposition Report' task can also trigger the 'Debt Collection Process Service Provider' task, which sends a 'Regression Procedure Completed' task to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Lastly, the 'Event Based Gateway 5' task checks for a 'Regression Possible?' task and sends a 'Payment Refusal Justified?' to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. If the refusal is justified, it leads to the 'Regression Procedure Completed' task, which closes the process.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Potential Regression Report' and can end in two ways: either with a 'Regression Procedure Completed' task or with a 'Debt Collection Process Service Provider' task. The process can also be interrupted by a 'Payment Refusal Justified?' task, which can lead to a 'Regression Procedure Completed' task or a 'Debt Collection Process Service Provider' task.
