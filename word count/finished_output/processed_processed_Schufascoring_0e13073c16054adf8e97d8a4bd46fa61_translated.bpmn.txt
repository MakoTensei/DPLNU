 In the financial services ecosystem, a series of orchestrated events and gateways work together to process and respond to Schufa requests. Here's a natural flow of these processes:

1. A Schufa request is created, triggering the 'EventBasedGateway1' to forward a 'Schufa request\ncreated' event.
2. The 'EventBasedGateway1' then sends a 'Schufa request\narrived' event to the 'Could the value\nare calculated?' gateway.
3. The 'Could the value\nare calculated?' gateway determines if the value can be calculated and forwards the 'Could the value\nare calculated?' event to the 'Scoring value' gateway.
4. The 'Scoring value' gateway processes the request and sends a 'Scoring level 2\nobtained' event to the 'Scoring level 2\nobtained' gateway.
5. The 'Scoring level 2\nobtained' gateway then sends a 'Level 2 result\nforwarded' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.
6. The 'EventBasedGateway1' forwards the 'Level 2 result\nforwarded' event to the 'Continue scoring result Level 2' gateway.
7. The 'Continue scoring result Level 2' gateway processes the request and sends a 'Level 2 result\nforwarded' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.
8. The 'EventBasedGateway1' forwards the 'Level 2 result\nforwarded' event to the 'Level 2 scoring\ndetermined' gateway.
9. The 'Level 2 scoring\ndetermined' gateway determines the scoring level and sends a 'Level 2 scoring\ndetermined' event to the 'Report Scoring Level 2' gateway.
10. The 'Report Scoring Level 2' gateway reports the scoring level and sends a 'Level 2 scoring\ndetermined' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.
11. The 'EventBasedGateway1' forwards the 'Level 2 scoring\ndetermined' event
