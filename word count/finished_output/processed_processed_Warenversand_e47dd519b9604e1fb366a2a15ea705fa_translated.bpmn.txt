 In the bustling world of logistics, a series of tasks are orchestrated to ensure the seamless delivery of goods. Let's dive into the intricate dance of these tasks and their corresponding gateways:

1. **Book Insurance**: When a customer inquires about insurance for their shipment, the system triggers the 'Insurance required?' gateway.
