 When a large amount of goods is dispatched, the process begins with the 'Goods dispatched' event, which triggers the 'Select your offer' task, leading to a consultation with a 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', where the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated to check insurance requirements. Once insurance is confirmed, the process continues to 'ExclusiveGateway2' again for further processing.


Parallelly, the 'Goods dispatched' event also triggers the 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for the 'Specialist' and then to 'ParallelGateway4' for delivery preparation. The 'Delivery preparation completed' event marks the end of the process, with 'ParallelGateway4' being the final point of contact.


Throughout this process, the 'large amount?' event acts as a trigger for both 'Select your offer' and 'Insurance necessary?' tasks, which are essential for handling large shipments. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' serves as a critical junction for the flow of tasks, while 'ParallelGateway3' and 'ParallelGateway4' handle the dispatch and delivery preparation, respectively.
