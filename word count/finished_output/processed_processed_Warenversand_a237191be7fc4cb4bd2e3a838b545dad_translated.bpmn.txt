 In the process of shipping goods, the first step is to determine the shipping method, which is influenced by whether a special delivery is necessary. This decision leads to the selection of an offer, which in turn requires the involvement of a specialist. Once the offer is selected, the shipping method is finalized, and a quote is created. If a special delivery is necessary, the insurance liability is determined, and the goods are sent to ExclusiveGateway2.

ParallelGateway4 is involved when a specialist is selected, and it connects to both ExclusiveGateway2 and ParallelGateway5. ExclusiveGateway3 is the next step after determining insurance liability, and it connects to ParallelGateway5.

The process concludes with the goods being packaged and sent for collection, which is facilitated by ParallelGateway5. The entire process starts with the event 'Goods be sent' and ends with 'EndEvent0'.
