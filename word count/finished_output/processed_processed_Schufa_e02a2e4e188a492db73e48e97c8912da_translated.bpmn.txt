 The system starts with a 'Contact us' event, which triggers the 'Level 1 Scoring' process. This process takes in 'Contact us' input and sends results to the 'Results?' gateway. The 'Results?' gateway then forwards the results to'sid-B18FC27B-1920-41E7-BE00-D46DD6C79B1C' and'sid-23F7628B-9FE2-43E3-BFBD-A656877EF385'.

Simultaneously, the 'Contact us' event also triggers the 'Further information' process, which takes in 'Schufa answer' input and sends it to the 'Get scoring?' gateway. The 'Get scoring?' gateway then forwards the input to 'EndEvent2' and 'Scoring'.

The 'Scoring' process takes in 'Get scoring?' input and sends it to the 'forward scoring' gateway. The 'forward scoring' gateway then sends the results to 'EndEvent3'.

The 'Schufa answer' event triggers the 'forward scoring' process, which takes in 'Schufa answer' input and sends it to 'EndEvent3'.

The 'Requirement Frontend' event does not have any incoming or outgoing connections in this system.

The 'EndEvent0', 'EndEvent1', and 'EndEvent2' events do not have any incoming connections in this system.

The 'EndEvent3' event receives input from the 'forward scoring' process and does not have any outgoing connections.
