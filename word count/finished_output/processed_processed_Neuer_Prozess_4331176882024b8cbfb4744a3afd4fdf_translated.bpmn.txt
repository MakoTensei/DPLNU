 In the process of obtaining a Schufa report, the system initiates a 'Schufa show\nrequired' event, which triggers the 'Result\nReport' gateway to generate the necessary report. Concurrently, a 'Scoring request\nobtained' event is triggered, leading to the 'EventBasedGateway1' gateway, which subsequently sends a 'Delay' report. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request\nobtained' event also initiates the 'Scoring\nLevel 1' process, sending the task to 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway then forwards the task to 'EventBasedGateway1', which in turn sends a 'Delay' report. The 'Scoring\nLevel 1' process results in a 'Result\nLevel 1\nReport' being generated and sent to 'EventBasedGateway1'. The 'Scoring\nLevel 1' task also triggers the 'Scoring\nLevel 2' process, which sends the task to 'Result\nLevel 2\nReport' gateway. The 'Result\nLevel 2\nReport' is then sent to 'EventBasedGateway1'. Finally, the 'Scoring request\nsend' event initiates the 'Scoring request\nobtained' process, which sends the task to 'ParallelGateway2', and subsequently to 'EventBasedGateway1'.
