 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural language format:

1. When a customer experiences hunger, they initiate the process by ordering food (StartEvent3).

2. The order is then processed and the customer is informed that their food is ready for pickup (EventBasedGateway0).

3. The customer goes to the court of justice to pick up their food.

4. At the court of justice, the customer is informed that their food is ready for pickup.

5. The customer picks up their food and is then informed that they can eat it.

6. After eating, the customer's hunger is satisfied, and they no longer feel famished.

7. The process ends with the customer's satisfaction.
