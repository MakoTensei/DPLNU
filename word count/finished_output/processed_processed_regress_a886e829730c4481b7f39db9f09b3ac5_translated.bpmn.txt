 The process begins with a report of a regression, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between different gateways and tasks.

1. The report of a regression ('Regress reported\n') initiates the process, leading to the task 'Check regression' ('sid-6A3DE901-2815-4F52-A6D8-D6162660E6DE') that checks the reported regression. This task has an exclusive gateway outgoing connection to 'ExclusiveGateway2' ('sid-E6D141B1-9E01-4541-91AB-68BE5010FB3B').

2. Upon receiving the 'Check regression' task, 'ExclusiveGateway2' ('sid-E6D141B1-9E01-4541-91AB-68BE5010FB3B') processes the task and sends it to 'Regress edited' ('sid-1F4AA9F9-689B-4970-A7B2-128CD1604D9A') if the regression is confirmed.

3. If the 'Regress edited' task is triggered, it sends the task to 'ExclusiveGateway7' ('sid-E6D141B1-9E01-4541-91AB-68BE5010FB3B') for further processing.

4. 'ExclusiveGateway7' ('sid-E6D141B1-9E01-4541-91AB-68BE5010FB3B') has two incoming connections: 'Check the receipt of funds' ('sid-42DA1D77-59B1-42E5-ADD9-71543CA1530A') and 'Any objection?' ('sid-3293144F-F61B-45E5-ADCA-83EBCFB8AAC2').

5. If 'Check the receipt of funds'
