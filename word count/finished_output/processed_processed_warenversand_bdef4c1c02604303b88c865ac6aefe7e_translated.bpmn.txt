 In the shipping process, the following tasks are handled by specific gateways:

1. When a special shipment is necessary, the request is directed to ExclusiveGateway3, which also handles the 'Filling the package note' task.

2. If a shipping order goes one way, it triggers a request for a 'Request Spedition 3 quote' through ParallelGateway4, which also handles the 'Special offer 1' task.

3. The 'Select your offer' task is processed through ParallelGateway6, which also receives the 'Insurance close' request.

4. The 'Packaging goods' task is directed to ParallelGateway7, which also handles the 'Insurance close' request.

5. The 'Goods sent' event is the final step, with ParallelGateway6 and ParallelGateway7 being involved in the process.

The gateways involved in the process are:

- ExclusiveGateway3: Handles 'Filling the package note', 'Special offer 1', and 'Check insurance' tasks.
- ParallelGateway4: Handles 'Request Spedition 3 quote' and 'Special offer 1' tasks.
- ParallelGateway5: Handles 'Request Spedition 3 quote' and 'Check insurance' tasks.
- ParallelGateway6: Handles 'Shipping order goes one', 'Select your offer', and 'Packaging goods' tasks.
- ParallelGateway7: Handles 'Packaging goods' and 'Insurance close' tasks.

The process starts with a 'Shipping order goes one' event, which triggers a 'Request Spedition 3 quote' task. This request is processed through ParallelGateway4. The 'Select your offer' task is then handled by ParallelGateway6, which also receives the 'Insurance close' request. The 'Packaging goods' task is directed to ParallelGateway7, which also handles the 'Insurance close' request. Finally, the 'Goods sent' event is the last step, with ParallelGateway6 and ParallelGateway7 being involved in the process.
