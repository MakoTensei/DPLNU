 When a shipment event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and interactions with various gateways. The process begins with the shipment event, which leads to a question about insurance. This question is directed to the 'Question: Insurance / Yes / No?' gateway, which has incoming connections from the shipment event.

If the user chooses 'Yes' for insurance, the process continues to the 'Complete insurance' task, which has an outgoing connection to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
