 In the world of scoring requests, a series of events and gateways work together to ensure that scoring results are obtained and processed efficiently. The process begins when a 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event triggers the 'forward delay message' gateway, which then sends a 'Request ready\nFinished' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway is responsible for forwarding the request to the appropriate level of scoring.

Meanwhile, a 'Request\nReport' event is sent to the 'Return scoring result' gateway, which in turn sends a 'Request ready\nFinished' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway is responsible for handling the results obtained from the scoring process.

As the scoring process progresses, the 'Result\navailable?' event is triggered, which sends a 'Request ready\nFinished' message to both 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This ensures that the results are ready to be processed and forwarded to the appropriate gateways.

The 'Level 1 Scoring' event triggers the 'Level 2 Scoring' event, which also sends a 'Request ready\nFinished' message to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This ensures that the results from the second level of scoring are ready to be processed.

Finally, the 'Request ready\nFinished' messages are sent to the 'Delay message\nobtained' and 'Level 2 Scoring' events, signaling the completion of the scoring process.

In summary, the scoring process involves a series of events and gateways working together to obtain and process scoring results. The 'Schufascoring\nrequested' event initiates the process, while the 'Request ready\nFinished' messages ensure that the results are ready to be processed and forwarded to the appropriate gateways.
