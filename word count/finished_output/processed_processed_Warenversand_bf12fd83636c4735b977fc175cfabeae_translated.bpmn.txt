 In the logistics process, the system starts with the event 'Goods are to be shipped' (sid-BDB90364-884A-422A-B2ED-57A71EBD53FB), which triggers the task 'Provide goods for collection' (sid-3117AD33-5E38-43E4-B645-D48F19169FA5). This task receives incoming data from 'Goods are to be shipped' and sends out 'Goods made available' (sid-720F0E5A-D3B3-4D8A-BE71-1AA5CEAEB1F4) as an output.

Simultaneously, the 'Is special shipment necessary?' event (sid-38760201-9148-479A-A833-28BCB79C0477) initiates the 'Packaging goods' task (sid-EAA84DBB-D141-4830-834E-CD8088C8E929), which connects with 'ParallelGateway3' (incoming) and sends 'ParallelGateway2' (outgoing) as a result.

The 'Is insurance necessary?' event (sid-22ED671E-34F2-41F0-B728-027356751AAD) triggers the 'Complete package insurance' task (sid-62409D17-0FEB-4CD1-A5E3-AAE53BE23E5E), which receives 'Is insurance necessary?' as an input and outputs 'Package insurance' (sid-C6524C73-278B-437C-9649-2CFBF5F3C3BB).
