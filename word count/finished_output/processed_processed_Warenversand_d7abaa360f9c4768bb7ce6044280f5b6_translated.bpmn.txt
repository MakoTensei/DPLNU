 When a customer initiates the process with "Goods for shipping," the system triggers the "Pick up an offer for forwarding" task, which involves selecting an offer for the forwarding of the goods. This task then connects to the "ExclusiveGateway1," which further leads to the "Goods ready for dispatch" event after considering the "Type of shipping?" inquiry. Concurrently, the "Type of shipping?" inquiry also connects to the "ExclusiveGateway3" and "ExclusiveGateway1," which are part of the insurance process. Once the insurance decision is made, the "Goods ready for dispatch" event is finalized, marking the end of the process.
