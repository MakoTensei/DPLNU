 In the scoring process, a request for scoring is initiated, which triggers a series of events and interactions between different components.

1. The process begins with a 'Scoring\nRequired' event, which has no incoming connections but sends a message to 'Report Scoring Level 2 to Frontend'.

2. A 'Scoring request\nwe are' event is then triggered, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

3. The 'Scoring request\nwe are' event then connects to 'Scoring Level 1', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

4. The 'Scoring Level 1' event sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then connects to 'Scoring completed'.

5. The 'Scoring immediately possible?' event connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to 'Scoring supplied'.

6. The 'Scoring supplied' event connects back to 'ExclusiveGateway2', completing the process.

Additionally, there are other events and connections that occur during the process:

- 'Scoring Level 1' connects to 'IntermediateCatchEvent6', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

- 'Scoring Level 2' connects to 'Report Level 2 scoring', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

- 'Report delay to Frontend' connects to 'IntermediateCatchEvent6', which then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

- 'Report Level 2 scoring' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then connects to 'Scoring supplied'.

- 'Delay' connects to 'Report delay to Frontend', which then connects to 'IntermediateCatchEvent6'.

- 'ExclusiveGateway0' connects to 'EventBasedGateway3', which then connects to 'Delay'.

- 'EventBasedGateway3' connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0' and 'Delay'.

This flow of events and connections ensures
