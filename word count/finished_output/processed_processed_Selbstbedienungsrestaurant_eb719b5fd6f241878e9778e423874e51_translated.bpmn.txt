 Let's describe the process flow in a more natural language, incorporating the given names and connections:

1. A guest accesses the restaurant, triggering the event 'Access restaurant'. This leads to the guest adding their order, which is then sent to the court for processing.

2. The court receives the guest's order and selects the appropriate court for the case. The order is then sent to the kitchen for preparation.

3. Once the order is ready, the kitchen notifies the court, and the court prepares to deliver the food to the guest.

4. The court receives the notification that the order is ready and reports this to the kitchen, signaling that the food is ready to be served.

5. The kitchen delivers the food to the guest, who then finishes their meal.

6. After the guest finishes eating, the kitchen calls the guest back after 5 minutes to ensure they are satisfied with the service.

7. If the guest is not satisfied, the process repeats from step 4. If the guest is satisfied, the kitchen supplies the food to the guest.

8. The court receives a report that the food has been supplied to the guest, and the process concludes.

9. If the guest requires further assistance, the court calls them back, and the process repeats from step 4.

10. The court also has the ability to visit the Tresen (a place related to the case) when the food is ready, and the food is then supplied to the guest.

11. The court can also trigger the 'Pieper piept' event when the guest finishes eating, indicating that the guest has finished their meal.

12. The court can also trigger the 'Welcome' event when the guest finishes eating and the food is ready to be served, welcoming the guest and supplying the food.

13. The court can also trigger the 'Judgment on the Enrichments' event when the order is ready, leading to a report being sent to the court and the kitchen being notified to prepare for the next order.

14. The court can also trigger the 'Cook ready' event when the order is ready, indicating that the kitchen is prepared to serve the next order.
