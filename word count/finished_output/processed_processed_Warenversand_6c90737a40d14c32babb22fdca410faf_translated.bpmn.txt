 In the order of receiving an offer, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Pick up offers' task, where the offer is received through 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The offer is then passed to the 'Select your offer' task via 'Offers arrived' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The selected offer is forwarded to the 'Specialist' task through 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Specialist' task then sends the offer to 'ExclusiveGateway2' for the 'Insurance close' task, which is initiated by 'ExclusiveGateway0'. After the insurance close, the offer is packaged by the 'Packaging goods' task, which receives the offer through 'ParallelGateway3' and sends it to 'ParallelGateway4'. Finally, the 'Provide for collection' task is triggered, which sends the package to 'EndEvent0' through 'ParallelGateway4'.
