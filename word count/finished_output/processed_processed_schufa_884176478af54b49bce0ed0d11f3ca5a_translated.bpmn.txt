 In the scoring process, a Scoring Required event triggers the Send Scoring to Schufa gateway, which then sends the Result Scoring Level1 arrived message to the Result Scoring Level1 arrived gateway. The Delay Report event, upon receiving a Scoring request obtained, initiates the perform scoring level1 process at the perform scoring level1 gateway. This process is followed by the perform scoring level2 process at the perform scoring level2 gateway, which sends the Result Scoring Level2 arrived message to the Result Scoring Level2 arrived gateway. The Result Scoring Level2 arrived gateway then sends the Total reported message to the EventBasedGateway1, which in turn sends the Total reported message to the End Events. Additionally, the Result Scoring Level1 arrived gateway sends the Total reported message to the EventBasedGateway1. The Delay Report event also sends the Total reported message to the EventBasedGateway1.
