 The process begins with the 'Order Report' event, which triggers the 'Complete Insurance' task. This task is initiated by the 'Special Delivery Necessary?' gateway, which receives the 'Order Report' event. Once the insurance is completed, the 'Check Insurance' task is triggered by the 'Order Report' event, which is then followed by the 'Complete Insurance' task.

Next, the 'Parallel Gateway 3' receives the 'Order Report' event and triggers the 'Packing Goods' task. This task is followed by the 'Delivering Goods' task, which is initiated by the 'All Preparations Completed?' gateway. The 'Delivering Goods' task is then followed by the 'Product is Provided' event, which signifies the end of the process.

In summary, the process involves the following steps:
1. 'Order Report' event triggers 'Complete Insurance' task.
2. 'Check Insurance' task is triggered by 'Order Report' event.
3. 'Packing Goods' task is triggered by 'Parallel Gateway 3'.
4. 'Delivering Goods' task is triggered by 'All Preparations Completed?' gateway.
5. 'Product is Provided' event signifies the end of the process.
