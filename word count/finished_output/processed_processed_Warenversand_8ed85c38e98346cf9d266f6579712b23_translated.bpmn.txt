 In a complex logistics system, there are several tasks and gateways involved in the process of delivering goods. Let's break down the tasks and their corresponding gateways:

1. The first task, "3 Offers from forwarders," involves an offer from ExclusiveGateway0, which can be accessed through ParallelGateway4. This offer leads to a selection process, where the user can choose their offer, which is handled by Specialist. Specialist then directs the user to ExclusiveGateway3, which is responsible for delivering the goods.

2. The second task, "Feeling a pack ticket," involves ParallelGateway4, which can be accessed through ParallelGateway6. This task leads to ParallelGateway5, which in turn directs the user to ParallelGateway7 for the delivery of the goods.

3. The third task, "Select your offer," is directly connected to ExclusiveGateway0, which can be accessed through ParallelGateway4. This task leads to Specialist, who then directs the user to ExclusiveGateway3 for the delivery of the goods.

4. The fourth task, "Complete insurance," involves Insurance certificate required? which can be accessed through ExclusiveGateway0. This task leads to ExclusiveGateway2, which then directs the user to ExclusiveGateway3 for the delivery of the goods.

5. The fifth task, "Packaging goods," involves ParallelGateway6, which can be accessed through ParallelGateway4. This task leads to ParallelGateway7 for the delivery of the goods.

In addition to these tasks, there are also start and end events in the system. The start event, "StartEvent0," can be accessed through ParallelGateway6 and leads to ParallelGateway7 for the delivery of the goods. The end event, "Goods delivered," can be accessed through Insurance certificate required? and ExclusiveGateway3, and it signifies the completion of the delivery process.

In summary, the logistics system consists of various tasks and gateways, such as ExclusiveGateway0, ParallelGateway4, Special
