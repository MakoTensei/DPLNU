 When a customer initiates the process to check their order, the system triggers the 'StartEvent0' and directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway2'. From there, the customer is prompted to fill in their insurance card, which leads to 'ParallelGateway3'. After selecting their offer, the system proceeds to 'ParallelGateway4' for packaging the goods. Once the goods are packaged, the system moves to 'Shipment' to deliver the goods to the customer. This entire process is initiated by 'StartEvent0' and concludes with 'Shipment'.
