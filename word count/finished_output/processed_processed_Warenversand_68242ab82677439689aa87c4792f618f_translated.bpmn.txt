 In the e-commerce process, a series of tasks and gateways work together to pick up offers, add them to the cart, and prepare for shipping. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the picking up of offers. The 'Shipping size?' event acts as a gateway, receiving input from 'StartEvent0' and directing it to 'Add to Cart' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Once an offer is added to the cart, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' takes over, handling the commission for 'Spediteur 1' and forwarding the offer to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. 'ExclusiveGateway2' then manages the commission for 'Spediteur 2' and 'Spediteur 3', and also handles the completion of insurance and the filling of the package note, which are dependent on the 'Shipping size?' event.

The 'ParallelGateway4' receives input from 'StartEvent0' and 'Shipping size?', and directs it to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'Delivering goods'. The 'Delivering goods' task is connected to 'ParallelGateway5', which in turn leads to the end of the process with 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the e-commerce process starts with 'StartEvent0', picks up offers through 'Shipping size?', adds them to the cart, and prepares for shipping by handling commissions, insurance, and package filling. The process concludes with 'EndEvent0'.
