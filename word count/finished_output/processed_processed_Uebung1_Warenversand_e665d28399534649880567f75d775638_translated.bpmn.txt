 The process begins with the 'Shipment' event, which triggers the 'Pick up 3 offers' task, utilizing the 'ParallelGateway3' to initiate the process. The 'Pick up 3 offers' task then sends the offer to the 'InclusiveGateway1', which in turn triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. This task uses 'InclusiveGateway2' to complete the process.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipment' event also triggers the 'Specialist' task through 'Special shipment?', which uses 'ParallelGateway4' to send the shipment to the 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'Specialist' task then sends the shipment to 'ParallelGateway4' for further processing.

The 'Goods packaging' task is initiated by the 'Shipment' event, which uses 'ParallelGateway3' to send the goods to 'InclusiveGateway2'. The 'InclusiveGateway2' then sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4' for final preparation.

The 'InclusiveGateway1' task is triggered by the 'Clearing the shipping mode' event, which uses 'ParallelGateway3' to initiate the process. The 'InclusiveGateway1' then sends the cleared shipping mode to 'InclusiveGateway2' and 'InclusiveGateway2' sends the cleared shipping mode to the 'End Event' task, 'Shipment\nprepared', which completes the process.

In summary, the process involves multiple tasks and gateways, starting with the 'Shipment' event and ending with the 'Shipment\nprepared' event, with various tasks and gateways working together to ensure the smooth handling and preparation of the shipment.
