 In response to hunger, a task order is initiated to fulfill the need for food. Once the order is obtained, a Pieper report is generated, which triggers a series of events. The Pieper report leads to the pickup of food, which results in a beeping sound indicating the food is ready. Following this, the food is invoiced, and the process is handed over to the customers. Meanwhile, the Pieper and handover to customers event informs Koch about the order. Concurrently, the food preparation process begins at the rich location, and staff information is provided. The process concludes with the occurrence of famine, which is triggered by the Pieper report and the wait until order event.
