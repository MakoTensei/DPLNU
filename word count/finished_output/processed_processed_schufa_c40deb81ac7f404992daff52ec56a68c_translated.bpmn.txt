 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the 'Scorelevel\nobtained' task, which is triggered by the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task then leads to the 'EndEvent0', which is also connected to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Scoring\nperform' task, which is connected to 'Level?' task. The 'Level?' task then leads to the 'Level 2 process\nStart', which is triggered by'sid-C02765F0-E838-410D-9B4B-4972B2DE5FB8'. This process further leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', which is connected to'sid-B02D8AE9-48BF-4B94-9518-24078FBF1818'. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' is also connected to 'EndEvent0', completing the scoring process.
