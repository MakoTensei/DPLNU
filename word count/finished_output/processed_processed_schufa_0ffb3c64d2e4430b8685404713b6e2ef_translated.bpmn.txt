 In the scoring process, a StartEvent0 initiates the scoring request, which triggers the 'Start scoring request' task. This task then sends a 'Scoring result level 1' to the 'Scoring result level 1' gateway, which in turn forwards the result to the 'forward scoring' task. Concurrently, the 'Request request' event triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which sends a 'Is the result already fixed?' query to the 'Is the result already fixed?' gateway. This gateway, upon receiving the query, sends a 'Scoring level 2' to the 'Scoring level 2' task and a 'Delay received' message to the 'Wait for Scoring Level 2' task. The 'Wait for Scoring Level 2' task then awaits the 'Scoring level 2' task to proceed. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring result level 1' task sends a 'Delay' message to the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which waits for the 'Is the result already fixed?' query before proceeding. Once the 'Is the result already fixed?' query is received, the 'Scoring level 2' task is triggered, and the process concludes with the 'Send scoring result' task, which sends the final scoring result.
