 Upon receiving the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' event, the system initiates the process of 'Delivering goods' through the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which checks if 'Insurance necessary?' is required. If the answer is affirmative, the system proceeds to 'Complete insurance' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which finalizes the process by sending 'Shipping costs\nFinished'. Concurrently, 'Filling the package note' and 'Packaging goods' are triggered through 'ParallelGateway4', ensuring that the goods are properly packaged and the package note is filled before delivery.
