 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the selection of shipping companies. This leads to the 'Offer 3 shipping companies' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway2'. From there, the user can select their preferred shipping company, which then sends the user to the 'Select your offer' task. This task is connected to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn leads to the 'Ordering' task. The 'Ordering' task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway3', which then leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, the 'Select your offer' task also sends the user to the 'Packaging goods' task, which is connected to the 'ParallelGateway2'. The 'Packaging goods' task then leads to the 'ParallelGateway3', which also leads to the 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the process involves selecting a shipping company, choosing a shipping offer, and then packaging the goods for shipping. The process ends with the 'EndEvent0'.
