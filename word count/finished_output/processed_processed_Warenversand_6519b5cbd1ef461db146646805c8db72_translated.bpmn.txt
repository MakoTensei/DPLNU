 The process begins with the 'Shipping goods' event, which triggers the 'InclusiveGateway3' to handle the incoming task. This gateway then forwards the task to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for packaging the goods. Once the goods are packaged, the 'ParallelGateway5' sends them out as 'Goods sent'.

In parallel, the 'Shipping goods' event also triggers the 'Verification' task, which is handled by the 'InclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then sends the task to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which in turn forwards the task to the 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then sends the task to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

Meanwhile, the 'Fill your package' task is triggered by the 'Shipping goods' event and is handled by the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway sends the task to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which forwards it to the 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then sends the task to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

Lastly, the '3 offers' task is triggered by the 'Shipping goods' event and is handled by the 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway sends the task to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which forwards it to the 'Specialist'. The 'Specialist' then sends the task to the 'ParallelGateway5', which is responsible for packaging the goods.

In summary, the 'Shipping goods' event triggers a series of tasks that are handled by various gateways, ultimately leading to the packaging and shipping of the goods. The 'Goods sent' event marks the end of the process.
