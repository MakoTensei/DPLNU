 The process begins with the 'Possible regression Report' event, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between different components of the system.

1. The 'Possible regression Report' is received and sent to the 'Payment send on request' task. This task is responsible for initiating a payment process based on the report.

2. The 'Payment send on request' task then sends a request to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' to proceed with the payment process.

3. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the request and forwards it to the 'Regress test' task. This task is responsible for regressing the system to ensure that the payment process is functioning correctly.

4. The 'Regress test' task completes its regression and sends a notification to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' indicating that the regression test is complete.

5. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the notification and forwards the request to the 'Regression verworn' task. This task is responsible for verifying the regression results and determining if the payment process is functioning as expected.

6. The 'Regression verworn' task completes its verification and sends a notification to the 'Collection Mission' task. This task is responsible for collecting the payment and completing the mission.

7. The 'Collection Mission' task receives the notification and completes the payment collection process.

8. The 'Collection Mission' task then sends a notification to the 'Debt collection' task, indicating that the payment has been successfully collected.

9. The 'Debt collection' task receives the notification and completes the debt collection process.

10. The process ends with the 'Collection Mission' task and the 'Debt collection' task completing their respective tasks, ensuring that the payment process is functioning correctly and the debt is collected.
