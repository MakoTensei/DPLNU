 In a system designed to handle scoring requests, the process begins with an initial event, 'Scoring request', which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between various components.

1. The 'Scoring request' event is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which then forwards the request to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This gateway sends a 'Follow-up' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' and also sends a 'Get delay message' to the 'Delay note' component.

2. The 'EventBasedGateway2' also sends a 'Follow-up' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' and a 'Get delay message' to the 'Delay note' component.

3. The 'StartEvent1' event is triggered, which sends a 'Send delay notice' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

4. The 'Scoring request' event is processed by the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which sends the 'Results obtained' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

5. The 'Send delay notice' message from the 'StartEvent1' event is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then sends the 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

6. The 'Results obtained' message from the 'perform scoring level 1' task is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which forwards it to the 'EndEvent0'.

7. The 'Scoring request' event triggers the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which sends the 'Send results from Scoringlevel2' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

8. The 'Send delay notice' message from the 'StartEvent1' event is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then sends the 'EndEvent0' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

9. The 'Send results from Scoringlevel2' message from the 'perform scoring level 2' task is received by the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which forwards it to the 'EndEvent0'.

10. The 'Waiting period
