 In the process of scoring, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Immediate investigation possible' gateway, leading to the determination of 'Scoring Level 1'. This is achieved through the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which upon completion, results in 'Scoring Level 1 determined'. Subsequently, the 'Scoring Level 1 determined' gateway connects to the 'EndEvent0', concluding the first scoring level.

Following the completion of 'Scoring Level 1', the system progresses to 'StartEvent1', which similarly leads to the 'Immediate investigation possible' gateway. This gateway then connects to the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which upon completion, results in 'Scoring Level 2 determined'. The 'Scoring Level 2 determined' gateway then connects to the 'EndEvent1', concluding the second scoring level.

In summary, the system starts with 'StartEvent0', which leads to 'Immediate investigation possible', determining 'Scoring Level 1'. After completing 'Scoring Level 1', the system moves to 'StartEvent1', leading to 'Immediate investigation possible' again, determining 'Scoring Level 2'. Both scoring levels are concluded with their respective 'EndEvent's.
