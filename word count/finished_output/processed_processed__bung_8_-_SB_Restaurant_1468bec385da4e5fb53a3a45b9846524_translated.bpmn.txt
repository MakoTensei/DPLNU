 A customer experiences hunger and decides to visit a restaurant. Upon arrival, they are prompted to select their meal option. After making their selection, they proceed to add their order to the restaurant's system. Once the order is placed, the restaurant prepares the meal.

The customer is then informed about the meal's readiness, and they are invited to pick up their food. After enjoying their meal, the customer leaves the restaurant.

The process begins with the customer feeling hungry, which triggers the "Hunger" start event. This leads to the "IntermediateCatchEvent1," where the customer selects their meal option. The selected offer is then added to their order.

Following the order placement, the restaurant prepares the meal, which is communicated to the customer through the "IntermediateCatchEvent3" start event. The customer picks up their meal, and the process concludes with the "EndEvent1."

In summary, the flow of events is as follows:

1. Customer feels hungry (Hunger)
2. Customer selects their meal option (IntermediateCatchEvent1)
3. Customer adds their order (IntermediateCatchEvent2)
4. Restaurant prepares the meal (IntermediateCatchEvent3)
5. Customer picks up their meal (IntermediateCatchEvent4)
6. Customer leaves the restaurant (EndEvent1)
