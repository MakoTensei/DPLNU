 The logistics process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Secretariat collects offers' task. This task receives offers from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends them to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. The 'ExclusiveGateway0' then forwards the offers to the 'Secretariat selects 1 offer' task, which selects one offer and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

Meanwhile, 'ParallelGateway3' is responsible for collecting offers and sending them to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task also receives offers from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends them to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then forwards the selected offer to the 'Logistics Manager An Insurance' task.

Simultaneously, 'ParallelGateway3' also collects goods for collection and sends them to 'EndEvent0'. The 'Warehouse workers packaged' task receives goods from 'ParallelGateway5' and sends them to 'EndEvent0'.

In summary, the logistics process involves the 'Secretariat collects offers' and 'Secretariat selects 1 offer' tasks, which work together to select an offer for forwarding. The 'ParallelGateway3' task collects offers and goods for collection, while the 'Warehouse workers packaged' task packages the goods. The selected offer is then forwarded to the 'Logistics Manager An Insurance' task, and the collected goods are sent to 'EndEvent0'.
