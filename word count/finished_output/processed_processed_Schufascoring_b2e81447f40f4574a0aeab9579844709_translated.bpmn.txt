 In a system where a scoring process is initiated, the journey begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Scoring 1' task, represented by the gateway'sid-631E1E26-119F-4BDF-91E1-63C1DD02E901'. This task has no incoming connections but leads to the 'Scoring 1 successful?' gateway'sid-sid-A8412DCC-3999-4F89-B6E7-B81AFF6DACAD', which is connected to the 'EndEvent1' with the gateway'sid-AD1B30C7-36AA-4C46-8CE3-455BC91EB87B'. Additionally, the 'Scoring 1' task also leads to the 'Scoring created' event'sid-07FAD08B-54B1-43A8-A5E7-45B5CBEE43CC' and the 'Scoring 1 created' event'sid-28F7CD32-B07D-4E81-8298-486C1E935F43', both of which have no incoming connections.
