 The process begins at the Restaurant, where an order is placed. This order triggers a series of events:

1. The order is received by the Restaurant, which then sends the order to the Selection of the court.

2. The Selection of the court processes the order and sends the Order of the court to the Restaurant.

3. The Restaurant receives the Order of the court and sends a confirmation to the Pieper, causing it to vibrate.

4. The Pieper's vibration triggers the Order payment/\nGet Piepers event, which sends the order to the Collection of the court.

5. The Collection of the court processes the order and sends the Consumption of the court to the Guest.

6. The Guest consuming the pie triggers the Guest is full event, which completes the process.


In parallel, the court also processes the order:

1. The Order of the court is received by the court, which then sends the Court of Justice event to the Pieper.

2. The Court of Justice event triggers the Pieper vibrates event, which sends the Pieper vibrating to the Order payment/\nGet Piepers event.

3. The Order payment/\nGet Piepers event sends the Pieper to the Cash and cash\nProcurement of Piepers event.

4. The Cash and cash\nProcurement of Piepers event sends the Pieper to the Redemption Pieper, court is ready event.

5. The Redemption Pieper, court is ready event sends the Guest appears event to the Gateway.

6. The Guest appears event triggers the EndEvent1 event, which completes the process.


The Gateway also plays a role in the process:

1. The Court of Justice event triggers the EventBasedGateway0 event.

2. The EventBasedGateway0 event sends the EndEvent1 and EndEvent2 events to the court.

3. The Guest appears event triggers the IntermediateCatchEvent6 event.

4. The IntermediateCatchEvent6 event sends the EndEvent2 event to the Gateway.


The process can be summarized as follows:
