 The system begins with the 'Insurance potential regressive' event, which triggers a check for regressivity and sends an incoming message to the 'Regressive?' gateway. This gateway then connects to the 'Regressibility Check' task, which further processes the incoming message. Concurrently, the 'Insurance potential regressive' event also connects to the 'Debt collection service provider' task, which sends an incoming message to the 'EventBasedGateway3'.

The 'EventBasedGateway3' receives messages from both the 'Insurance potential regressive' event and the 'Debt collection service provider' task, and forwards them to the 'Opposition Check' gateway. This gateway connects to the 'Opposition Check' task, which processes the incoming message.

The 'Opposition Check' task also sends an incoming message to the 'Opposition Report' task, which processes the message and sends it to the 'EndEvent0' event.

Meanwhile, the 'Regressive?' gateway connects to the 'Regressibility Check' task, which processes the incoming message and sends an outgoing message to the 'Regressive?' task.

The 'Regressive?' task then connects to the 'Cash receipt book' task, which processes the incoming message and sends an outgoing message to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Debt collection service provider' task also connects to the 'EndEvent0' event, which processes the incoming message and sends an outgoing message to the 'EndEvent0'.

Finally, the 'EndEvent0' event receives messages from all the tasks and gateways, and processes them, completing the flow.
