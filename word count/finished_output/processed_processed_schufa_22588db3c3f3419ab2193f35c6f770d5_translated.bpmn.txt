 In a system designed to handle scoring levels and query processing, there are several key components that interact to achieve the desired outcomes. When the process begins with 'StartEvent0', it triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which awaits an incoming 'StartEvent0' signal. Upon receiving this signal, the task initiates a 'Delay?' event, which can lead to two possible outcomes: 'Delay?' or 'EndEvent0'. If 'Delay?' is the outcome, the process then moves to 'perform scoring level 2', which requires 'Information about delay' as an incoming signal. This information is provided by the 'Information about delay' event, which itself is triggered by the 'Delay?' event. Once 'Information about delay' is received, the process concludes with 'EndEvent0'.

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which also awaits a 'StartEvent1' signal. Upon receiving this signal, the task triggers a 'Quick answer possible?' event, which can result in either 'Quick answer possible?' or 'EndEvent1'. If 'Quick answer possible?' is the outcome, the process proceeds to 'Check whether fast query is possible', which requires 'Quick answer possible?' as an incoming signal. This check is triggered by the 'Quick answer possible?' event. If the check determines that a fast query is possible, the process concludes with 'EndEvent1'.

In summary, the system starts with 'StartEvent0' or 'StartEvent1', which triggers the respective scoring level tasks. These tasks can lead to 'Delay?' or 'Quick answer possible?' events, which in turn provide the necessary information for the next steps. The system concludes with 'EndEvent0' or 'EndEvent1', depending on the outcomes of the events triggered by the initial tasks.
