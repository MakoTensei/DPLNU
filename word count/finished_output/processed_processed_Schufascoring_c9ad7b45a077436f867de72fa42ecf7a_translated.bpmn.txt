 In the process of handling a customer's request to show their Schufa data, the system initiates the 'Schufa show\nrequired' task, which leads to an 'Incomplete clarification\nis there?' event. This event is directed to the 'Incomplete clarification\nis there?' gateway, seeking further information. Once the necessary clarification is obtained, the system proceeds to the 'Scoring request\nobtained' task, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' event. This event is responsible for sending the 'Scoring request\nobtained' message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. Subsequently, the 'Determine final scoring result' task is executed, resulting in the 'ExclusiveGateway1' event again, this time to pass the final scoring result. The 'Scoring result\nobtained' event concludes the process, marking the completion of the scoring request.
