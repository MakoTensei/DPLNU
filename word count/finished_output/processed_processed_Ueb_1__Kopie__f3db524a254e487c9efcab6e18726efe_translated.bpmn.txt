 Upon obtaining the shipping costs, the process begins with determining the quantity needed for the shipment. This task is followed by a decision-making process to select the best offer, which is facilitated by ParallelGateway4. Once the offer is selected, the insurance requirements are checked to ensure the goods are adequately covered. After confirming the insurance, the goods are packaged and sent to ParallelGateway5 for further processing. At ParallelGateway5, the insurance is completed, and the shipping costs are prepared for delivery. The process concludes with the goods being delivered, having gone through all the necessary steps and gateways.
