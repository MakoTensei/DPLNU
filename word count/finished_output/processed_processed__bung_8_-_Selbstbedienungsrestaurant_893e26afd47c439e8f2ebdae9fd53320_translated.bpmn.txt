 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph format:

When a customer experiences hunger, they trigger the "Hunger" event. This leads to the "Add your order" event, where the customer can place their food order.

Once the order is placed, the "Customer orders" event is initiated, which in turn triggers the "Retrieve customer" event. This is where the system retrieves the customer's order details.

The order details are then used to trigger the "Food ordered" event. This event prompts the kitchen staff to start preparing the food.

As the food is being prepared, the "inform employees" event is activated, notifying the kitchen staff that the food is ready to be cooked.

After the food is cooked, the "Food cooked" event is triggered, and the kitchen staff is informed that the food is ready to be served.

Meanwhile, the "Pieper" (a character or system component) takes the order and moves it through the process, ensuring that the food is cooked and served in a timely manner.

Once the food is served, the customer's hunger is satisfied, and the "Famine" event is triggered, indicating that the customer's hunger has been addressed.

If the customer takes a break and returns after 5 minutes, the "5 min" event is triggered, indicating that it's time to serve the food again.

Throughout this process, the system ensures that the customer's order is retrieved, processed, and served efficiently, with the "Issued" event indicating that the order has been successfully handled.
