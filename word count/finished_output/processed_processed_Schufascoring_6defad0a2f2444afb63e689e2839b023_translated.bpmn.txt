 In the scoring process, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'EventBasedGateway1', which then sends a request to'sid-7309914D-8CC8-4BB3-9F70-5F20201E68ED' for the 'Send scoring request to Schufa'. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' activates 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn directs the flow to 'ParallelGateway2'. This gateway is responsible for the 'Level 1 scoring' task, which is then passed to'sid-EF92E702-9A8F-4DBE-84F2-DDA06DD5F65A'. Upon completion of the Level 1 scoring, the system proceeds to 'Level 2 scoring' by routing the output to'sid-A6E18CFF-D3F4-4DD8-82E2-F6B43796AF2C'. The Level 2 scoring task concludes with the output being sent to'sid-E414F294-32A9-4FEF-A31D-F69874546D62'. The entire process is orchestrated through a series of gateways and events, ensuring a smooth and efficient scoring workflow.
