 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway3' to handle the incoming 'Shipping costs\nobtained' message. This gateway then forwards the message to 'ParallelGateway4'.

'ParallelGateway4' receives the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' message and sends it to both 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. 'ExclusiveGateway3' continues the process by sending the message to 'Special delivery\nno man?', which in turn sends the message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

'ExclusiveGateway2' handles the 'Insurance\nnotwenidg?' message and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, 'ExclusiveGateway3' also receives the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' message from 'ParallelGateway4' and sends it to 'EndEvent0'.

'EndEvent0' receives the 'ParallelGateway5' message and completes the process.

In summary, the process flow is as follows:

1. 'Shipping costs\nobtained' event triggers 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
2. 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends 'Shipping costs\nobtained' to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'Special delivery\nno man?'.
3. 'ParallelGateway4' sends 'Shipping costs\nobtained' to 'ExclusiveGateway3' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
4. 'ExclusiveGateway2' handles 'Insurance\nnotwenidg?' and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
5. 'ExclusiveGateway3' sends 'Shipping costs\nobtained' to 'EndEvent0'.
6. 'EndEvent0' receives 'ParallelGateway5' and completes the process.
