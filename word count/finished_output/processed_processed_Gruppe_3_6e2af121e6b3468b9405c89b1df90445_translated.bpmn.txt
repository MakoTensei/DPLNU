 The system initiates communication through the EventBasedGateway0, which triggers the StartEvent0. This event leads to the IntermediateCatchEvent4, which in turn results in the Level 2 score being generated. Concurrently, the StartEvent1 event triggers the Level 1 score through the EventBasedGateway0 and the ParallelGateway2. The Level 1 score is then forwarded to the About us Info Frontend, which concludes the process with EndEvent0. Additionally, the StartEvent1 event also leads to the Level 2 score through the > 30 sec gateway, which sends the score to the Level 2 score endpoint.
