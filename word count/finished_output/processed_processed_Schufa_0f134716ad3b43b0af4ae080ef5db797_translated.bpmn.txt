 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the scoring request, which triggers the 'Evaluate scoring result' task. This task then leads to the 'EndEvent0', signaling the completion of the evaluation. Following this, the 'StartEvent1' commences the waiting for the final result, which in turn triggers the 'Wait for final result' task. This task concludes with the 'EndEvent1', indicating the completion of the waiting period. Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent1' also initiates the 'Results directly available?' task, which ends with the 'EndEvent3' upon completion. Additionally, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Final result is there?' task, which concludes with the 'EndEvent0'. Lastly, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Editing scoring request' task, which ends with the 'EndEvent3'. The 'Delayed result' task, triggered by 'StartEvent1', concludes with the 'EndEvent2'.
