 When you start your search, the system triggers the 'StartEvent0' process, which then leads to further work. This further work process, identified by'sid-6FC34587-D7D3-4B66-AD15-C66AE5C5F0D5', is the initial step in the search process. Once the further work is completed, it triggers 'Scoring Level 1', which is represented by'sid-D7013E1F-3F22-4956-B263-DE674D0AFFDB'. After the scoring process, the system moves to 'Scoring Level 2', which is initiated by'sid-2AF16EA4-778D-4DBB-9E2F-2AF62EF42D9F' and concludes with 'EndEvent1'. If the search is successful, the 'Successful?' gateway, identified by'sid-514966D0-A4E7-4EEF-A31E-BC8CB5272B20', is activated, leading to 'EndEvent0' and also triggering 'EndEvent1' for the scoring levels.
