 In a financial institution's lending process, a series of tasks and gateways work together to handle Schufa inquiries and scoring. When a Schufa inquiry is received, it triggers a sequence of events and tasks:

1. The 'Schufa in question' event is initiated, which sends a request to the 'Scoring' gateway. This gateway then sends a 'Schufa request terminated' event to the 'EventBasedGateway0' and'receive deferred notification' event to itself.

2. The 'StartEvent1' event is triggered, which sends a 'Send Scoring 1 to Bank' event to the 'Scoring' gateway and 'Result Scoring 1 is fixed' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

3. The 'Run scoring level 1' task is executed, which detects a delay and sends a 'Delay detected' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This event triggers the 'Result Scoring 2 is fixed' event, which sends a 'Send Scoring 2 to Bank' event to the 'Scoring' gateway.

4. The 'Run scoring level 2' task is executed, which also detects a delay and sends a 'Delay detected' event to the 'EventBasedGateway1'. This event triggers the 'Scoring query Finished' event, which completes the lending process.

Overall, the system ensures that Schufa inquiries are processed efficiently, with scoring tasks and events coordinating to provide timely and accurate results.
