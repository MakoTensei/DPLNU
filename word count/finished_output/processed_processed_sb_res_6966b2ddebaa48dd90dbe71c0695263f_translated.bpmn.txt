 In a bustling court system, a person feeling hungry initiates a search for food. This triggers a series of events and interactions within the system.

1. The person feeling hungry (Hunger felt) starts the process by triggering StartEvent1. This event leads to the exclusion of certain actions, represented by EventBasedGateway0.

2. The search for food begins, and the person picks up food (Pick up food). This action leads to the IntermediateCatchEvent1, which eventually results in the person feeling famished (Famine).

3. The person then proceeds to the Pieper, where they wait (on Pieper wait). This waiting period is marked by the IntermediateCatchEvent3, which eventually leads to the food being ready (Food ready).

4. The food is then prepared and handed over to the person (Food is handed over). This action is facilitated by the EventBasedGateway0, which connects the Food ready and IntermediateCatchEvent3 events.

5. The entire process takes 5 minutes, as indicated by the StartEvent1 triggering the 5 minutes event.

In summary, the person feeling hungry starts the process by triggering StartEvent1, leading to a series of events and interactions that ultimately result in the food being handed over to them.
