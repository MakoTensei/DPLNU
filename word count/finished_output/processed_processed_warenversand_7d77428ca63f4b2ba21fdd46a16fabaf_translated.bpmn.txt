 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'three offers' task, allowing the user to select an offer. Once an offer is selected, the 'Special delivery' gateway is activated, leading to the 'Specialist' task, where the user is connected to a specialist for further assistance. The specialist then guides the user through the 'Fill in packages' task, which includes an optional 'Insurance?' step. If the user opts for insurance, the process proceeds to the 'Insurance close' gateway, leading to the 'EndEvent0'. If the user declines insurance, the 'Goods ready for collection' task is initiated, also leading to the 'EndEvent0'. This entire process ensures a smooth transition from the initial offer selection to the final collection of goods.
