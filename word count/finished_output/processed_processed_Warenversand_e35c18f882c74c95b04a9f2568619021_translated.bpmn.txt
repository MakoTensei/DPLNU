 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Separation of shipment' task, leading to the 'ParallelGateway7'. The 'ParallelGateway7' then connects to the 'Provision for collection' task, which in turn links to the 'Goods ready for collection' end event.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Pick up offers' task, which connects to the 'Select your offer' task via 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'Select your offer' task then leads to the 'Specialist' task, which further connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

Meanwhile, the 'StartEvent0' also triggers the 'Packaging goods' task, which connects to the 'Goods ready for collection' end event via 'InclusiveGateway5'.

The 'Insurance necessary?' task, initiated by 'StartEvent0', connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task, which in turn links to the 'Packaging goods' task.

Lastly, the 'Separation of shipment' task connects to the 'Provision for collection' task via 'ParallelGateway6', which also connects to the 'Goods ready for collection' end event.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to various tasks and gateways, ultimately resulting in the 'Goods ready for collection' end event.
