 A guest visits a restaurant and decides to choose a dish from the available options. While waiting in line, they patiently wait for their turn. Once it's their turn, they place their order, which is then processed and payment is collected. The kitchen prepares the meal, and the guest eagerly awaits its completion.

Meanwhile, the restaurant staff informs the employees about the order and the guest's presence. After the meal is ready, the staff hands it over to the guest. The guest enjoys their meal and, after a few minutes, returns to the restaurant to retrieve their payment.

The restaurant staff retrieves the guest and informs the employees about the completed order. The process concludes with the guest leaving the restaurant, and the restaurant staff updates their records accordingly.
