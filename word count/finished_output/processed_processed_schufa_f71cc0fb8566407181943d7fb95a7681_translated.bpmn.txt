 The scoring process begins with the 'StartEvent1' triggering the 'perform scoring level 1' task, which then sends a 'Scoring result clear' message to the 'Scoring result clear' gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends an 'EndEvent1' message to the 'perform scoring level 2' task, which is initiated by the 'StartEvent1'. The 'perform scoring level 2' task sends a 'Scoring to report back' message to the 'Scoring to report back' gateway, which receives the message from the 'EventBasedGateway1'. The 'EventBasedGateway1' also sends a 'Receive a waiting message' to the 'Receive a waiting message' gateway, which then sends a 'Scoring to report back' message to the 'Scoring to report back' gateway. Finally, the 'Scoring to report back' gateway sends a 'Scoring to report back' message to the 'Scoring Feedback' gateway, which sends a 'Scoring to report back' message back to the 'perform scoring level 2' task, completing the scoring process.
