 When a Schufa request is triggered, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the request and determine the customer's credit score. The process begins with the 'Schufa request\ntriggered' event, which sends a 'Delay display' task to the 'EventBasedGateway2'. This task is responsible for managing the delay before the scoring process starts.

Simultaneously, the 'Request\nReport' task is triggered, which sends a 'Determine Schufa Score Level 2' task to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task is responsible for determining the customer's credit score level based on the provided information.

The 'ExclusiveGateway1' then sends the 'Return Score' task to the 'Scoring\nuniquely determined\nare you?' gateway. This task is responsible for generating the customer's credit score based on the determined score level.

The 'Scoring\nuniquely determined\nare you?' gateway sends a 'Report delay' task to the 'EventBasedGateway2' and a 'Return Score' task to the 'EndEvent0'. The 'Report delay' task manages the delay before the report is sent, while the 'Return Score' task sends the final credit score to the 'EndEvent0'.

The 'EndEvent0' then sends a 'Delay\nentered' task to the 'EventBasedGateway2', marking the end of the process.

In summary, the system processes a Schufa request by triggering a sequence of tasks and gateways, determining the customer's credit score level, generating the score, and sending the report with a delay. The process is managed by the 'EventBasedGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway1' gateways, and the final score is sent to the 'EndEvent0'.
