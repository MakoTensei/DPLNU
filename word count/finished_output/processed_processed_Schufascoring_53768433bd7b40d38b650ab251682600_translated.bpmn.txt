 In the scoring process, a request for scoring is initiated by the 'Schufa scoring enroll' event, which triggers the 'Scoring request' event. This request is then processed by the '1. Scoring determined' task, which determines the scoring based on the incoming request. The '1. Scoring determined' task then sends outgoing messages to '1. Scoring determined' and'sid-4A93E398-A532-48AD-81E0-40352E55D554'.

Simultaneously, the '1. Scoring determined' task also sends incoming messages to'sid-923DC6E2-7CA6-4AA1-8838-FCC0047E6248' and'sid-F49BA917-AD84-4B39-9BDC-09AF0EB1C9BE'. These messages are part of the '1. Scoring determined' gateway, which further processes the scoring determined by the task.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' events are triggered by the 'Expect request' event, which is initiated by the 'Scoring request' event. These events send incoming messages to'sid-FB8B2C93-5CBA-46FF-B08D-278D140A66C8' and'sid-05B707A4-616D-4D2F-818E-A47AEE5F63B5' respectively, which are part of the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' gateways.

Finally, the 'Schufa scoring\nFinished' event is triggered by the '1. Scoring determined' task, which sends outgoing messages to'sid-5569D65C-ED2D-4DAB-AE2A-285A6317D678' and'sid-0374D30D-C3BC-40DA-89
