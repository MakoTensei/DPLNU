 The process begins with the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event, which triggers the 'ParallelGateway6' to initiate the packaging process. The 'Packaging goods' task is then activated, which requires the 'ParallelGateway7' to be involved. Once the goods are packaged, the 'Filling the package note' task is triggered, which also requires the 'ParallelGateway7'.

Simultaneously, the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event also triggers the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway. If the user confirms the necessity of insurance, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' is activated, which in turn leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' gateway then connects to the 'ParallelGateway7', which is responsible for delivering the goods.

Meanwhile, the 'Pick up offers' task is initiated, which requires the 'Type of shipping?' gateway. If the user selects a type of shipping, the 'Select your offer' task is activated, which leads to the 'Specialist' gateway. The 'Specialist' gateway then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for delivering the goods.

After the goods are delivered, the 'Explanation' task is triggered, which requires the 'Goods ready for dispatch' event. The 'ParallelGateway7' is involved in this task, which leads to the 'Goods ready for collection' event.

In summary, the process involves the following sequence of tasks and gateways:
