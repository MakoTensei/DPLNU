 Starting with the event 'Order of goods', the process unfolds as follows:

1. The 'Order of goods' event triggers the 'Insurance?' event, which has two outcomes: 'Insurance close' and 'no insurance cover'.

2. The 'Insurance?' event then leads to the 'ParallelGateway8' event, which has two outcomes: 'Provide merchandise for collection' and 'Exemption'.

3. The 'Provide merchandise for collection' event connects to the 'ParallelGateway6' event, which has three outcomes: 'no insurance cover', 'no insurance cover', and 'no insurance cover'.

4. The 'no insurance cover' outcome from the 'Provide merchandise for collection' event leads to the 'ParallelGateway7' event, which has one outcome: 'Exemption'.

5. Finally, the 'Exemption' event concludes the process.

In summary, the 'Order of goods' event initiates a chain of events that ultimately results in the 'Exemption' event. The process involves multiple gateways and outcomes, with the 'no insurance cover' outcome being the final pathway to the 'Exemption' event.
