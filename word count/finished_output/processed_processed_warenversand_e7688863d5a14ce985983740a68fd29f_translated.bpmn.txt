 In a logistics process, the following tasks are carried out:

1. The 'Spediteur 1' receives goods that are to be shipped and sends them to 'ParallelGateway6'.
2. 'Spediteur 2' also receives goods that are to be shipped and sends them to 'ParallelGateway6'.
3. 'Spediteur 3' receives goods that are to be shipped and sends them to 'ParallelGateway6'.
4. 'Packaging goods' prepares the shipment by filling the package note and sends it to 'ParallelGateway7'.
5. 'Goods ready for collection' are sent from 'ParallelGateway7' to 'EndEvent0'.
6. 'Insurance close' is triggered when insurance is required, and it sends the request to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The process starts with 'Goods are to be shipped', which is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. From there, the goods are sent to 'ParallelGateway6' by 'Spediteur 1', 'Spediteur 2', and 'Spediteur 3'. Meanwhile, 'Packaging goods' prepares the shipment and sends the filled package note to 'ParallelGateway7'. The goods are then ready for collection and sent to 'EndEvent0'. If insurance is required, the process is routed to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
