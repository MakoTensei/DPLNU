 The process begins with a 'Request Schufascoring' event, which triggers the 'Send Schufa request' task. This task sends a request to initiate the Schufa scoring process and results in an 'IntermediateCatchEvent2'. The 'Request Schufascoring' event also triggers the 'Request Schufascorfing' task, which leads to the 'perform scoring level I' task. This task sends an 'Info there?' event to the 'Info there?' gateway.

The 'Request Schufascorfing' task also triggers the 'forward Schufa Scoring results LII to frontend' task, which sends the scoring results to the frontend. The 'perform scoring level I' task also triggers the 'Scoring Level II' task, which sends the results to the'sid-500E17CE-1E02-4B58-80C6-853E329C28DF' task.

The 'Send Schufa request' task also triggers the 'Report delay' task, which sends a report of any delay in the scoring process. The 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' task results in the 'EndEvent0' event, which is triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway1' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' tasks.

In summary, the process starts with a 'Request Schufascoring' event, which triggers multiple tasks and events, including sending requests, performing scoring, and reporting delays. The results of the scoring process are then forwarded to the frontend, and any delays are reported. The process concludes with the 'EndEvent0' event, which is triggered by various tasks and gateways.
