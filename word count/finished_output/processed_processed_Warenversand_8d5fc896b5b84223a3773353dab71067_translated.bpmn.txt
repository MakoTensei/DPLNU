This task is linked to the gateway 'ParallelGateway4', which also connects to 'Offers from Pick up freight forwarders' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'Complete Insurance' task, which requires confirmation of insurance necessity, is connected to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway3'. This task is crucial for ensuring that the goods are adequately insured during transit.

The 'Special Offer Select' task, which involves choosing a special offer, is linked to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task allows the company to provide customized services to their clients.

The 'Package Tickets Filling' task, which involves filling out package tickets, is connected to 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This task ensures that all necessary information is included in the package tickets for efficient processing.

The 'Goods Packaging' task, which involves packaging the goods, is connected to 'ParallelGateway5'. This task ensures that the goods are securely packaged for transportation.
