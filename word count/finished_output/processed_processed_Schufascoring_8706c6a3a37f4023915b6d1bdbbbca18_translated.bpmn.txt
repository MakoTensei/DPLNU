 In a scoring system, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'perform scoring level 1' task, represented by the ID'sid-078E906E-74DD-428B-A39F-01325D6BC07F'. This task is then directed to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' with the ID'sid-5D8C0148-A249-457D-BAD7-14FD3C6C45C0'. 

Simultaneously, 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'perform scoring level 2' task, identified by the ID'sid-1254FA01-2DAA-4C88-80FD-3D9045AC5B9D'. This task also proceeds through 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is the same gateway used for the first scoring level.

The 'Result\nreached?' event, with the ID'sid-D1869EB4-3F81-4745-8222-EDB9F24888E9', is triggered by both scoring tasks and directs them to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', identified by the IDs'sid-2D52E765-3D58-41A6-BB04-CC2C1C9793A8' and'sid-51E7B89E-4491-41FB-BA54-56C84430BB24' respectively.

The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' events, with the IDs'sid-8E9DA2DD-23AB-4137-B950-9DB214148693' and'sid-1CB701F6-2F1F-4F6D-AEF3-56418C4727C2', mark the conclusion of the scoring process for both levels.
