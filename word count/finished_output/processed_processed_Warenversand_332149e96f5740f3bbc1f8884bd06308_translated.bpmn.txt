 The workflow begins with the 'StartEvent0' initiating the process. This event triggers the 'large Shipping quantity?' gateway, which then directs the flow to either'sid-50A8CBB9-74D8-4094-8618-E4C9A5F3C491' or'sid-478A1100-6C2B-4072-80C8-F4CC636BA966'.

From there, the process diverges based on whether the 'large Shipping quantity?' gateway sends the flow to'sid-50A8CBB9-74D8-4094-8618-E4C9A5F3C491' or'sid-478A1100-6C2B-4072-80C8-F4CC636BA966'.

If the flow goes to'sid-50A8CBB9-74D8-4094-8618-E4C9A5F3C491', it then proceeds to 'Pick up forwarding offers' gateway, which connects to'sid-6E060602-6A8E-447A-A998-CDB47329B9F6'. This gateway then sends the flow to'sid-D767A483-535F-43F9-A49E-6232E1BB5856', the 'Filling the package note' gateway.

On the other hand, if the flow goes to'sid-478A1100-6C2B-4072-80C8-F4CC636BA966', it connects to 'Pick up forwarding offers' gateway, which then sends the flow to'sid-B32B731A-0CD6-4ED4-B979-01560351F493', the 'Order / report to w
