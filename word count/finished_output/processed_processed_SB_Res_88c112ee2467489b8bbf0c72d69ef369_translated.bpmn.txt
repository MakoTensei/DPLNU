 In the Court of Justice, there are several tasks and events that are interconnected to address the issue of hunger. Let's describe the flow of these tasks and events in a more natural and descriptive way:

1. The Court of Justice receives a notification of hunger (Tracked Hunger) and triggers the EventBasedGateway0. This gateway connects the Court of Justice with the Snake Position 1 and EndEvent0.

2. The Court of Justice instructs the Snake Position 1 to take action. The Snake Position 1 is responsible for giving up an order (Order Give Up) and completing the task (Completion Obtained).

3. The Court of Justice also instructs the Pieper to be absent (Pieper Absent) and completes the task (Completion Obtained).

4. The Court of Justice instructs the Snake Position 1 to enter the Completion Obtained state, which leads to the EndEvent0.

5. The Court of Justice instructs the Snake Position 1 to enter the EndEvent0 state, which completes the task.

6. The Court of Justice receives a notification of hunger again and triggers the EventBasedGateway0. This gateway connects the Court of Justice with the Snake Position 1 and EndEvent1.
