 The process begins with the 'Shipping costs\nobtained' event, which triggers the 'Determine quantity' task, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4'. This task then leads to the '3 offers' task, which requires 'Shipping costs\nobtained' as input and outputs '1 selection'. The '1 selection' task connects to 'Specialist' through 'Lot?', which in turn connects to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Simultaneously, 'Check insurance requirements' task is initiated by 'Lot?', which also connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Complete insurance' task, which requires 'Insurance necessary?' as input, connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' task, receiving input from both 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'Insurance necessary?', leads to the 'Delivering goods' task, which outputs 'Shipment\nprepared'.

Meanwhile, the 'Packaging goods' task, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4', connects to 'ParallelGateway5'. The 'ParallelGateway5' task, which receives input from 'ParallelGateway4', outputs 'Shipment\nprepared'.

In summary, the process starts with obtaining shipping costs, determining the quantity, selecting an offer, checking insurance requirements, completing insurance, packaging goods, and finally preparing the shipment.
