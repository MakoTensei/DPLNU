 In the bustling world of logistics, a series of tasks are orchestrated through a network of gateways, ensuring the smooth delivery of goods. Let's dive into the intricate flow of these tasks:

1. When goods are to be shipped, the process kicks off at the 'Goods are to be shipped' start event. This triggers a request for a quote, which is sent to the 'Request a quote' gateway.

2. The 'Request a quote' gateway receives the request and forwards it to the 'ParallelGateway5' and 'ParallelGateway4' gateways.

3. 'ParallelGateway4' then sends the request to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for providing goods for collection.

4. Concurrently, 'ParallelGateway5' sends the request to 'Selection of freight forwarders' and 'Product is packaged' gateways.

5. The 'Selection of freight forwarders' gateway receives the request and sends it to 'ExclusiveGateway0'.

6. 'ExclusiveGateway0' forwards the request to 'ParallelGateway6', which is responsible for providing goods for collection.

7. Meanwhile, 'Product is packaged' gateway sends the request to 'ParallelGateway6' as well.

8. 'ParallelGateway6' receives the requests from both 'Selection of freight forwarders' and 'Product is packaged' gateways and sends them to the 'EndEvent0' gateway.

9. The 'EndEvent0' gateway receives the requests and completes the process, marking the successful delivery of goods.

In summary, the process begins with the start event 'Goods are to be shipped', which triggers a series of requests and forwardings through various gateways, ultimately leading to the 'EndEvent0' event, signifying the successful delivery of goods.
