 In the workflow described, the process begins with a 'Schufascoring' request for a report, which triggers a series of tasks and interactions between different components and gateways.

1. The 'Schufascoring' request for a report (Event ID:'sid-78044B3F-54E7-43D9-BCDC-2D537179CEA0') initiates the process by sending a 'forward delay' task to the 'forward delay' gateway (Event ID:'sid-C159E5EA-B5CA-4A1C-9017-E195699292C9').

2. The 'forward delay' task (Event ID:'sid-D3F688A4-5AA6-428C-A099-507B412404C5') is then processed by the 'Scoring 1 Calculate result' gateway (Event ID:'sid-6343BF37-64F3-42C4-A5F4-DDB0F5283F58'), which checks if Level 1 scoring is present.

3. If Level 1 scoring is present, the 'Scoring 1 result forward' task (Event ID:'sid-D4A957F8-05C3-49BF-8E92-7B3932960524') is sent to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' (Event ID:'sid-4334460C-6303-4A42-88F7-62FA13739751').

4. Concurrently, if Level 1 scoring is not present, the 'forward delay' task (Event ID:'sid-D3F688A4-5AA6-428C-A099-507B412404C5') is sent to the 'EventBasedGateway3' (Event ID:'sid-68633E8
