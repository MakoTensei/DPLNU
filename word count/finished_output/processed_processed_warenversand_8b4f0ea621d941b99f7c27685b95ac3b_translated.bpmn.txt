 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the initiation of the shipping process. The 'Secretariat clears shipping' task is then activated, which in turn sends a request to the 'Specialist' to handle the special shipment.

The 'Specialist' task is responsible for carrying out the special shipment. Once the special shipment is ready, the 'Specialist' sends out a notification to the 'Postal mail' task, indicating that the special shipment is ready for dispatch.

Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway4' task is triggered, which initiates the process of obtaining quotes from three different shipping companies - 'Spediteur 1 offers', 'Spediteur 2 offers', and 'Spediteur 3 offers'. The 'ParallelGateway4' task then sends out these quotes to the 'Specialist' for evaluation.

The 'Specialist' evaluates the quotes and selects the cheapest offer. The selected offer is then communicated to the 'ParallelGateway5' task, which finalizes the shipping process.

Once the shipping process is complete, the 'ParallelGateway5' task sends a notification to the 'EndEvent0', marking the completion of the shipping process.

In summary, the shipping process starts with the 'StartEvent0', followed by the 'Secretariat clears shipping' task. The 'Specialist' then handles the special shipment and communicates with the 'ParallelGateway4' task to obtain quotes. The 'Specialist' selects the cheapest offer and communicates this to the 'ParallelGateway5' task, which finalizes the shipping process and sends a notification to the 'EndEvent0'.
