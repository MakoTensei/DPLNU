 The process begins with the event'mgl. Regress gg.' which triggers the 'Check regression' task. This task checks for any regression issues and, upon completion, leads to the 'Close the process' task.

If a regression is detected, the process moves to the 'Regress?' gateway. This gateway determines the next steps based on the incoming'mgl. Regress gg.' event. If the regression is confirmed, the process proceeds to the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which then leads to the 'Reimbursement period expired' task.

On the other hand, if the regression is not confirmed, the process moves to the 'Close the process' task.

The 'Close the process' task can also be triggered by the 'Cash receipt from the VN' event, which leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' task.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' task can either lead to the 'Regression\ncompleted' task if the 'Cash receipt from the VN' event is received, or it can lead to the 'justified?' task if the 'EventBasedGateway4' event is received.

The 'justified?' task then leads to the 'Regression\ncompleted' task if the 'EventBasedGateway4' event is received, or it leads to the 'Closed' task if the 'Proceedings' event is received.

In summary, the process starts with'mgl. Regress gg.' and can end in either 'Closed' or 'Regression\ncompleted', depending on the events and gateways involved.
