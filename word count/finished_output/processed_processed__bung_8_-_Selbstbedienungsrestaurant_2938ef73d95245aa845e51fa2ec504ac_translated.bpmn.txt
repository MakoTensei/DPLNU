 Let's describe the sequence of events in a more natural flow:

1. A customer feels hungry and decides to add their order.
2. The order is received, and the kitchen prepares the meal.
3. The kitchen informs the employees that the meal is ready.
4. The kitchen places the meal on the row for pickup.
5. The customer picks up the meal.
6. The kitchen informs the employees that the meal is prepared.
7. The kitchen places the meal in the waiting area.
8. The kitchen informs the employees that the meal is ready to serve.
9. The kitchen serves the meal to the customer.
10. The customer enjoys the meal, and the kitchen informs the employees that the meal is consumed.

4. The customer picks up the meal.
5. The kitchen informs the employees that the meal is ready.
6. The kitchen serves the meal to the customer.
7. The customer enjoys the meal, and the kitchen informs the employees that the meal is consumed.

In this flow, the events are connected as follows:

- 'Feeling hungry' triggers 'Add your order'.
- 'Order arrived' triggers 'Meal preparation'.
- 'Meal is prepared' triggers 'Pick up meal'.
- 'Pick up meal' triggers 'Meal served'.
