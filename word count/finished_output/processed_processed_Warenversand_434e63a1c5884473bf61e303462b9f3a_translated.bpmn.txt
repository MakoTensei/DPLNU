 In the logistics process, various tasks are interconnected through a series of gateways. Starting with the 'Description' event, which triggers the 'Request offers for 3 forwardings' task. This task utilizes the 'ParallelGateway6' to process incoming 'Description' data and sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway5'.

Simultaneously, the 'Shipping note / Package note' task is initiated by 'ParallelGateway5', which receives data from both 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway6'. This task generates a 'Shipping note / Package note' and sends it to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Insolvency' task, on the other hand, is triggered by the 'Value' event. It uses 'ParallelGateway4' to process incoming 'Value' data and sends outgoing data to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Packaging goods' task is initiated by 'ParallelGateway4' and sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway5'. This task is responsible for packaging the goods and preparing them for shipping.

The 'Consumption of the order' task is triggered by the 'Description' event and uses 'ParallelGateway6' to process incoming 'Description' data. It sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway6'.

The 'Request offers for 3 forwardings' task, which was initiated by the 'Description' event, uses 'Quantity' data to send outgoing data to 'Add to Cart'.

The 'Fill in delivery note' task is triggered by 'ParallelGateway2' and uses 'Quantity' data to send outgoing data to 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'Goods for shipping' task is initiated by 'Quantity' data and sends outgoing data to'ready for dispatch'.

Finally, the'ready for dispatch' task is triggered by the 'Quantity' event and sends outgoing data to 'ParallelGateway6'. This task signifies that the goods are ready to be dispatched.

In summary, the logistics process involves various tasks and gateways that work together to handle different aspects of the
