 When an order is received, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure the order is processed correctly. First, the 'Order received' event initiates the 'Request a quote' task, which involves a specialist providing a quote for the order. If a special shipment is necessary, the 'Special shipment necessary?' event leads to the 'Filling the package note' and 'Complete insurance' tasks, both of which require ExclusiveGateway2. Once the special shipment is confirmed, the 'Special shipment necessary?' event also triggers ExclusiveGateway3, which then sends the order to 'ParallelGateway4' for packaging and readiness for shipment. Meanwhile, if insurance is needed, the 'Insurance necessary?' event sends the order to 'Complete insurance' and'ready for shipment' tasks through ExclusiveGateway2. Finally, the'ready for shipment' event signifies the completion of the order processing.
