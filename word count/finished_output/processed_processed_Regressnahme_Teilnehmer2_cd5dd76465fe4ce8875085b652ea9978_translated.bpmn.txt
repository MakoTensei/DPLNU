 When a regression report is received, the team checks for the possibility of a regression and initiates a process for resubmission. If a regression is deemed possible, a payment request is sent to the finance department to set up the resubmission process. Once the resubmission process is set, a cash receipt is issued, which triggers the booking of the entrance for the case. If the payment is justified, the case is delivered to the debt service providers. Conversely, if the payment is not justified, the denial of payment is considered. This decision leads to the delivery of the case or the expiration of the reimbursement period, depending on the outcome.
