 In the process of scoring, a request is initiated by the 'Schufascoring request' event, which triggers the 'IntermediateCatchEvent3' to route the request to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gatekeeper checks if the scoring result is available and, upon confirmation, proceeds to the 'Report results' event, which concludes the process.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' event triggers the 'Determining scoring' process, which calculates the scoring and sends the result to the 'Scoring calculated' event. This event then triggers the 'Recalculate scoring' event, which recalculates the scoring and sends the result to the 'Scoring 2 calculated' event.

The 'Scoring 2 calculated' event then triggers the 'EndEvent0', which concludes the process. This entire process ensures that the scoring is accurately determined and reported.
