 When a scoring request arrives, the system initiates the process by checking if a scoring level 1 can be determined. This is done through the 'Check if scoring level 1 could be determined' task, which receives the incoming 'Scoring request arrived' event and sends outgoing messages to 'Scoring detected?' gateway.

Upon receiving a 'Scoring detected?' response, the system proceeds to determine the final scoring result. This is achieved through the 'Determine final scoring result' task, which receives the incoming'sid-BACA27F2-B2AC-4B78-8F1D-543D513E3D79' message from the 'Scoring detected?' gateway. The task then sends outgoing messages to'sid-B2A19939-6288-45A4-8BC4-7BD3C6899967' gateway.

The 'Scoring detected?' gateway, upon receiving the 'Scoring request arrived' event, checks if scoring level 1 can be determined. If it can, the gateway sends outgoing messages to'sid-8FE7562E-D6C1-4855-9B78-E2640781843D' and'sid-B9BD83BA-3D41-4D07-B81C-47109547AFB6' gateways.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Scoring detected?' event and sends outgoing messages to 'Scoring' and 'Get delay message' tasks.

The 'Scoring' task, upon receiving the 'EventBasedGateway1' event, sends outgoing messages to'sid-E796A45C-F63C-4B57-A45F-70946B726B8B'.

The 'Get delay message' task, upon receiving the 'EventBasedGateway1' event, sends outgoing messages to'sid-69868C77-AB92-49B9-8
