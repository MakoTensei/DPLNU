 In a workflow system, a series of tasks and events are interconnected to ensure the smooth execution of a process. Let's explore the described scenario in a more natural flow description:

The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the initiation of the workflow. The first task, 'Check if Result Level 1 has been delivered?', is set to monitor the delivery of Result Level 1. This task is linked to 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which acts as an incoming event for the task.

Once 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' is received, the task 'Check whether scoring level 2 should be supported' is triggered. This task is connected to 'StartEvent1', which is the next step in the workflow. The task 'perform scoring level 1' is then initiated, which is linked to 'StartEvent1' as well.

The 'perform scoring level 1' task is responsible for executing the scoring process at Level 1. Upon completion, it sends an 'Implementation Level 2?' event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', which is the incoming event for the task 'Report Level 2'.

The 'Report Level 2' task is then executed, and it sends an 'EndEvent1' event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent3'. This event signifies the completion of the reporting process at Level 2.

Simultaneously, the 'Implementation Level 2?' event triggers the task 'perform scoring level 2', which is connected to 'StartEvent1'. The task 'perform scoring level 2' is responsible for executing the scoring process at Level 2.

Once the scoring process at Level 2 is completed, the task 'perform scoring level 2' sends an 'EndEvent3' event to 'Implementation Level 2?', indicating the completion of the scoring process at Level 2.

The 'Check whether scoring level 2 should be supported' task, upon completion, sends an 'EndEvent0' event to 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', signifying the end of the process.

In summary, the workflow starts with 'StartEvent0', followed by a series of tasks and events that ensure the delivery and reporting of Result Level 1, and the execution of scoring processes at Levels 1 and 2. The process concludes with the completion of
