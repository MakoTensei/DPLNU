 In the shipping process, the journey of goods begins with the 'Goods for shipping' event, which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to process the offer. This gateway then connects to 'ParallelGateway4', which is responsible for packaging the goods. Once packaged, the goods are sent to 'ParallelGateway7' for delivery. Upon successful delivery, the 'Goods delivered' event is triggered, marking the end of the shipping process.


Simultaneously, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' also handles the 'Select your offer' process, where the 'Specialist' is involved. The 'Specialist' then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2', which is responsible for completing the insurance for the goods.


Additionally, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' also manages the 'Rate this quantity' process, where the 'ParallelGateway1' is involved in the rate calculation.


In summary, the shipping process involves multiple gateways and specialists, ensuring that the goods are packaged, insured, and delivered efficiently.
