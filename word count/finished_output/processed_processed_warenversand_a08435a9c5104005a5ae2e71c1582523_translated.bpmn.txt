 When a gk goods dispatch event occurs, it triggers a series of tasks and gateways to ensure the goods are properly processed. First, the 'Specify quantity' task is initiated, which takes the gk goods dispatch as input and sends the output to 'ParallelGateway4'. Next, the 'Filling the postcard' task is activated, also receiving input from 'ParallelGateway4' and directing the output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Concurrently, the 'Packaging goods' task is triggered, which takes 'ParallelGateway4' as input and sends the output to 'ParallelGateway5'. Following this, the 'Delivering goods' task is initiated, receiving input from 'ParallelGateway5' and completing the process by outputting 'Goods delivered'. If insurance is required, the 'Insurance close' task is activated, taking 'Insurance required?' as input and directing the output to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This sequence of tasks and gateways ensures a smooth and efficient delivery process for the gk goods dispatch.
