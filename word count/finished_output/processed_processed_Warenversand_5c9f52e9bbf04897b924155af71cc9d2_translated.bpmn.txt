 In a logistics system, there are several tasks and gateways that work together to ensure the smooth processing of goods. Let's take a closer look at the flow of these tasks and gateways:

1. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Provide for Collection' task. This task is responsible for preparing the goods for collection.

2. The 'Provide for Collection' task then sends the goods to the 'ParallelGateway4' for further processing.

3. The 'ParallelGateway4' receives the goods and sends them to either 'ParallelGateway5' or 'ParallelGateway6' based on the specific requirements of the goods.

4. If the goods are sent to 'ParallelGateway5', it will eventually lead to the 'EndEvent0' task, which marks the completion of the collection process.

8. If the goods are sent to 'ExclusiveGateway2', it will eventually lead to the 'EndEvent0' task, which marks the completion of the collection process.

9. If the goods are sent to 'Insurance', it will be processed by the 'Insurance' task, which ensures that the goods are covered by insurance during transit.

10. After the insurance process, the goods are sent to the 'ParallelGateway6' for final processing.

11. The 'ParallelGateway6' then sends the goods to the 'Select offer' task, which selects the appropriate offer for the goods based on their specifications.

12. The 'Select offer' task then sends the goods to the 'Commissioning Spediteur' task, which is responsible for commissioning the sped
