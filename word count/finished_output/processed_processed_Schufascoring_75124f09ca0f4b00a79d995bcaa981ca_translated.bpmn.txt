 In the process of scoring requests to Schufa, a series of tasks and gateways work together to ensure a smooth flow of information. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Scoring request to Schufa' task. This task sends a request to Schufa and awaits a result. Once the result is received, it is sent to the 'Result\nSchufaservice' gateway, which then triggers the 'Scoring result available' task.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent0' also initiates the 'Sending information to Frontend' task, which sends the information to the frontend. The 'Scoring result available' task, upon completion, triggers the 'EndEvent0' and sends the result to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

Meanwhile, the 'Create your Score\nLevel 1' task, initiated by 'StartEvent1', sends a request to the 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This gateway then sends a 'Create delay message' to the 'Create your Score\nLevel 2' task, which in turn sends the scoring result to the 'Scoring result available' task.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', which triggers the 'Scoring request to Schufa' task and the 'Sending information to Frontend' task. The 'Scoring request to Schufa' task sends a request to Schufa and waits for a result, which is then sent to the 'Result\nSchufaservice' gateway. The 'Scoring result available' task sends the result to the 'EndEvent0' and the 'EventBasedGateway1'. The 'Create your Score\nLevel 1' task sends a request to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which sends a 'Create delay message' to the 'Create your Score\nLevel 2' task. The 'Create your Score\nLevel 2' task sends the scoring result to the 'Scoring result available' task, completing the process.
