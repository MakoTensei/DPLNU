 In the process of handling a special shipment, the system initiates with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the selection of an offer. Once the offer is selected, the 'Ordering expedition' task is triggered, which in turn leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway is responsible for filling the package note, and it also handles cases of insolvency.

Parallelly, the 'Special shipment?' event leads to the 'ParallelGateway3', which is responsible for selecting the offer and also connects to 'ParallelGateway4'. The 'ParallelGateway4' then delivers the goods, marking the end of the process.

In summary, the process starts with 'StartEvent0', leading to the selection of an offer, followed by the filling of the package note and the delivery of goods. The 'Special shipment?' event and 'Insolvency' event are also managed by the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.
