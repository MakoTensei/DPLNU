 The process begins with the 'Shipment\nMission' event, which triggers the 'Request 3 forwarders' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which in turn initiates the 'Check quantity' task. The 'Check quantity' task is linked to the 'Lot?' gateway, which then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

Once the 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Lot?' input, it sends the task to the 'Complete insurance' task. This task is connected to the 'Insurance necessary?' gateway, which then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'.

The 'ExclusiveGateway2' receives the 'Insurance necessary?' input and sends the task to the 'Check insurance requirements' task. This task is connected to the 'Lot?' gateway, which then leads to the 'ExclusiveGateway3' again.

The 'ExclusiveGateway3' receives the 'Lot?' input and sends the task to the 'Packaging goods' task. This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway4', which then leads to the 'ParallelGateway5'.

The 'ParallelGateway5' receives the 'ParallelGateway4' input and sends the task to the 'Delivering goods' task. This task is connected to the 'Goods\nmade available' event, which marks the end of the process.
