 When a customer inquires about a big crowd, the system triggers the 'big crowd?' event, which connects to ExclusiveGateway2. This gateway then forwards the request to ParallelGateway4, where the customer is presented with options to 'Choose a quote & order' or 'Complete insurance'. If the customer opts for 'Choose a quote & order', they are directed to ParallelGateway4, which leads them to the 'Provide merchandise for collection' endpoint, marking the end of the process. Alternatively, if the customer decides to 'Complete insurance', they are directed to ExclusiveGateway2, which then sends the request to ParallelGateway4. In both cases, the process concludes at the 'End' event, where the customer's request is finalized.
