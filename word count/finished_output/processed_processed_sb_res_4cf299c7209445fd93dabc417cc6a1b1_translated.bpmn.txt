 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural paragraph format:

1. When a user feels hungry, they initiate the process by selecting the "Select a court" option.
2. Based on their hunger, they choose the "Court of Justice" as their desired court.
3. At the Court of Justice, they request to "Get Pieper," which triggers the process to prepare the meal.
4. Once the meal is prepared, the user is notified that the food is ready, and they experience "Famine."
5. If the user wants to order food, they go back to the "Select a court" option and choose the "Court of Justice" again.
6. This time, they request to "Pick up food," which leads to the process of delivering the food to the user.
7. After receiving the food, the user can either eat it or return it if it's not satisfactory.
8. If the user returns the food, the process of "Adjusting Pieper" is initiated, where the user explains the issue and the usage of the food is adjusted accordingly.
9. If the user is satisfied with the food, they can end the process by completing the "Order design" and leaving the court.

In the gateways, the following decisions are made based on the user's actions:

- If the user feels hungry and chooses the "Court of Justice," they will either get the food or return it, depending on their satisfaction.
- If the user returns the food, they will go through the "Adjust Pieper" process.
- If the user is satisfied with the food, they will proceed to the "Order design" process.

The start events are triggered when the user feels hungry, and the end events are triggered when the user experiences famine or completes the order design.
