 In the world of software development, a series of tasks are interconnected through a network of gateways. Let's dive into the details of these gateways and their relationships:

1. **Regression Gateway**: This gateway, identified by the ID'sid-55057B07-7FB0-49FD-A5B7-F05138302A10', is responsible for handling regression tasks. It receives incoming tasks from two other gateways:'sid-BE7BC7C7-A322-462D-A450-A17A2670097E' and'sid-768F2D44-D7E6-4959-98AF-F8D17AA4E77C'. It then sends outgoing tasks to two other gateways:'sid-4B77FDB0-18F3-49FB-846E-D027B11214AC' and'sid-62AA761C-3761-448F-A2B0-4ADDDF46387B'.

2. **ExclusiveGateway1**: This gateway, identified by the ID'sid-2D96EE44-29E1-4CD0-ACC6-CF99499B3345', is an exclusive gateway that receives incoming tasks from two gateways:'sid-4B77FDB0-18F3-49FB-846E-D027B11214AC' and'sid-8CA97672-75E8-4269-A539-6BE216A1699F'. It then sends outgoing tasks to two other gateways:'sid-62AA761C-3761-448F-A2B0-4ADDDF46387B' and'sid-346AF15F-D27D-4DEB-97
