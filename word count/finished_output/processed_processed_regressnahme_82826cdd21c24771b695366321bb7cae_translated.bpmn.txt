 In the event of a possible regression after damage regulation, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to address the issue. The process begins with the 'Possible regression after completed Damage regulation' event, which triggers a request to send a payment to Vietnam. This request is handled by the 'Send payment request to VN' task, which has an exclusive gateway leading to the 'Set process for resubmission' task.

The 'Set process for resubmission' task, upon receiving the 'Regression possible?' signal, directs the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway connects to the 'Opposition' task, which sets the process for resubmission.

Meanwhile, the 'Send payment request to VN' task also receives a 'Cash receipt' signal, which leads to the 'Book incoming money' task. This task completes the process by sending a notification that the process has been completed.

In another scenario, the 'Payment refusal justified?' event, triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway4', leads to the 'Close' task, which marks the process as completed. This event also connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Proceedings' task.

The 'Proceedings' task, upon receiving the 'Opposition' signal, directs the process to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway connects to the 'Regressnah-\nme test' task, which checks for a regression after damage regulation.

The 'EventBasedGateway4' also sends a 'Cash receipt' signal, which leads to the 'Book incoming money' task, completing the process.

Lastly, the 'EventBasedGateway4' sends a 'Destroying the Debt DL' signal, which triggers the 'Destroying the Debt DL' task, leading to the 'Process\nOpen' task. This task marks the process as open and ready for further actions.
