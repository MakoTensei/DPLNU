 Upon receiving an order, the system initiates a series of tasks to ensure the order is processed correctly. First, it checks if the order involves a large amount of goods, which triggers a check for commodity insurance necessity. If insurance is deemed necessary, the system proceeds to get insurance. Concurrently, the system requests a quote for the order.

Once the quote is obtained, the system checks if the order requires a large amount of goods again, prompting a selection of a freight forwarder. The goods are then packed, and the system determines if shipment via a freight forwarder is needed. If so, the system sends the shipment to the freight forwarder.

During the shipment process, the system consults a specialist to handle the freight forwarder's services. After the specialist's involvement, the system concludes the order process with an end event.

Throughout this process, the system communicates with various gateways to manage the flow of information and ensure that each step is completed before moving on to the next.
