 1. Start with the event 'StartEvent0', which triggers the process of checking the case.
2. Upon checking the case, the system determines if a regress is needed. If a regress is required, the process moves to 'Regress?', otherwise, it proceeds to 'Complete the process'.
3. If a regress is not needed, the system checks if money has been received. If money has been received, the process moves to 'Money received?' and then to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.
4. At 'ExclusiveGateway3', the system checks if the money received is from the VN. If it is, the process moves to 'Disclosure of debt collection service providers'. If not, it proceeds to 'Cash receipt posted'.
5. If the money received is from the VN, the system then checks if there is opposition to debt collection. If there is opposition, the process moves to 'After opposition to debt collection'. If not, it proceeds to 'Cash receipt posted'.
6. If there is opposition to debt collection, the system checks if the objection is justified. If the objection is justified, the process moves to 'Objection justified?', otherwise, it proceeds to 'Complete the process'.
7. If the objection is justified, the system discloses the debt collection service providers. If not, it proceeds to 'Complete the process'.
8. Upon completing the process, the system checks for any regress. If a regress is needed, the process moves to 'Regress?', otherwise, it concludes with 'No regression'.
9. If no regress is needed, the system checks if the objection was granted. If the objection was granted, the process concludes with 'Objection granted'.
10. If the objection was not granted, the process concludes with 'Complete the process'.
11. Finally, the system posts the cash receipt, concluding the process with 'Cash receipt posted'.
