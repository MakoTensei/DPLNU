 Let's describe the flow of events in a more natural and understandable way:

1. When a guest feels hungry, they add their order to the system.
2. The system retrieves the guest based on the order received.
3. The guest receives information about the ordered milling.
4. The system puts the meal in vain, which triggers an event.
5. The event notifies employees to inform them about the meal preparation.
6. Meanwhile, the system triggers an event when the guest is not available for 5 minutes.
7. The event notifies the system to deliver the food to the guest.
8. Once the food is delivered, the guest picks up the food.
9. The system delivers the food to the guest.
10. After the guest receives the food, they experience famine, indicating that they are no longer hungry.

This flow of events ensures that the guest's hunger is addressed by delivering the ordered food, and the system efficiently manages the process from order to food delivery.
