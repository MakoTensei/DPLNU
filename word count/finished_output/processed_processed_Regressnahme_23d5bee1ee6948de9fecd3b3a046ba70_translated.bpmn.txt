 In a system where various tasks and gateways interact, we have the following scenario:

When a 'Regression report' arrives, it can trigger two tasks: 'Test' and 'Book'. The 'Test' task will then lead to a 'Yes/No' gateway, which can result in 'EndEvent0'. On the other hand, the 'Book' task will also lead to the 'Yes/No' gateway, but it will also result in 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Ship' task, which is triggered by a 'Regression report', will lead to a 'Payment period >30days' gateway. This gateway will then result in 'EndEvent0'.

The'maize' task, which is triggered by a 'Payment period >30days' gateway, will lead to an 'Examination' task.

The 'Examination' task, triggered by an 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' gateway, will lead to an 'Auditing' task.

The 'Auditing' task, triggered by an 'Objection?' gateway, will lead to a 'Number' task.

The 'Number' task, triggered by an 'Objection?' gateway, will lead to a 'Reasons' task.

The 'Incoming payment' task, triggered by a 'Regression report', will lead to an 'EndEvent0'.

The 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' task, triggered by the 'EventBasedGateway2' gateway, will lead to an 'Examination' task.

The 'Payment period >10' task, triggered by a'maize' gateway, will lead to an 'EndEvent0'.

The 'Regression report' task, triggered by a 'Reception' gateway, will lead to a 'Test' task.

The 'EndEvent0' task, triggered by the 'Yes/No' gateway, will lead to an 'EndEvent0' task.

The 'Yes/No' gateway, triggered by a 'Regression report', will lead to an 'EndEvent0' task.

The 'Objection?' gateway, triggered by a 'Reception' gateway, will lead to a 'Number' task and a 'Reasons' task.
