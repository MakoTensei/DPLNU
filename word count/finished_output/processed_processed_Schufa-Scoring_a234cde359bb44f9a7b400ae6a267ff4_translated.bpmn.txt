 In the banking sector, a scoring system is initiated when a 'Schufa scoring request' event occurs, triggering a series of tasks and interactions between various gateways and services.

1. The process begins with a 'Schufa scoring request' event, which sends an incoming message to the 'Head Scoring to Frontend' gateway. This gateway is responsible for forwarding the request to the appropriate service for scoring.
