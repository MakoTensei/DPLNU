 The system starts with a Regression report event, which triggers the ExclusiveGateway0. This gateway then directs the report to ExclusiveGateway3. Meanwhile, a VN spoke again event is received by ExclusiveGateway1, which sends it to ExclusiveGateway2. Concurrently, an EventBasedGateway4 event is triggered, which sends the VN spoke again event to ExclusiveGateway3 and ExclusiveGateway2. The ExclusiveGateway2 then leads to the Inkasso service provider delivering the Reimbursement period event. On the other hand, the ExclusiveGateway3 receives the VN spoke again event and the Possibility to check regression event, leading to the Process closed event. Lastly, the Book money receipt event triggers ExclusiveGateway3, which closes the process.
