 In a bustling law firm, a series of events unfold as cases are processed and closed. The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Check the case' task, initiating a series of actions. This task is linked to the'resource' gateway, which in turn leads to the 'Close Case' event.

As the case progresses, the 'Received Money' event occurs, prompting the 'Check the Reason' task. This task is connected to the 'President' gateway, which then leads to the 'Close the event' action.

Meanwhile, the 'due date' event triggers the 'Hand over to Coll' task, which is connected to the 'EventBasedGateway2' gateway. This gateway leads to the 'Forward to Coll' event, which eventually results in the 'Close the event' action.

Simultaneously, the 'Booked' event occurs, leading to the 'Check the Reason' task. This task is connected to the 'Simple Case' gateway, which then leads to the 'Close the event' action.

Finally, the 'Closed case' event is triggered, which is connected to the 'Booked' task. This task is linked to the 'EventBasedGateway2' gateway, leading to the 'Close the event' action.

Throughout this process, the 'President' and 'Coll' gateways play crucial roles in managing the flow of events and tasks, ensuring that each case is thoroughly checked, reasoned, and closed efficiently.
