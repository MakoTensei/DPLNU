 In the process of handling various tasks, the following workflow is established:

1. The 'Regress' task initiates the process by sending a request to 'ExclusiveGateway0'. This task is responsible for checking authorization.

2. The 'Payment on request' task, upon receiving a request, sends the information to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This task also sends the 'Date of expiry' to 'EndEvent2'.

3. The 'Pre-booking' task, upon receiving money, sends the information to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.

4. The 'Proceedings' task, upon receiving a contradiction from the Vendor (VN), sends the information to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

5. The 'Debt collection' task, upon receiving the 'Date of expiry', sends the information to 'EndEvent2'.

6. The 'Regress' task, after passing through 'ExclusiveGateway0', reaches 'EndEvent0'.

7. The 'Proceedings' task, after passing through 'ExclusiveGateway3', reaches 'EndEvent1'.

8. The 'Debt collection' task, after passing through 'EndEvent2', reaches its final destination.

The process starts with the 'Regress' task and ends with the 'Debt collection' task. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' acts as a critical junction for multiple tasks, including 'Regress', 'Pre-booking', and 'Debt collection'.
