 In the process of scoring, a task named "Scoring request" is initiated, which requires scoring and results in a delayed message. This task triggers a "StartEvent1" that leads to the "Scoring results" gateway, where the scoring process is performed. Once the scoring is completed, the "Scoring result is passed" task is triggered, which sends a message to the "Message received" gateway, indicating that the scoring result is ready.

Simultaneously, a task named "Send message to sales staff" is also initiated, which is delayed due to the scoring process. This task is triggered by the "StartEvent1" and eventually leads to the "Reporting to Bank\nperform" task.

The "Scoring results" gateway receives the "StartEvent1" and sends the final result to the "Final result reported" end event. The "ParallelGateway2" gateway, which is triggered by the "1. perform scoring" task, sends the scoring results to the "Reporting to Bank\nperform" task and the "EndEvent0" task, indicating the completion of the scoring process.

In summary, the scoring process starts with a "Scoring request" task, which triggers a "StartEvent1" and leads to the "Scoring results" gateway. The scoring results are then passed to the "Scoring result is passed" task, which sends a message to the "Message received" gateway. Meanwhile, the "Send message to sales staff" task is delayed and eventually leads to the "Reporting to Bank\nperform" task. The "Scoring results" gateway sends the final result to the "Final result reported" end event, and the "ParallelGateway2" gateway sends the scoring results to the "Reporting to Bank\nperform" task and the "EndEvent0" task, completing the scoring process.
