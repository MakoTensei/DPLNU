 The process begins with the dispatch of goods, which triggers the 'Goods dispatched they are' event, leading to the activation of 'ParallelGateway4'. This gateway then connects to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn sends the goods to 'ParallelGateway4'. The goods are then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway2' where the 'Check quantity' task is performed. The 'Check quantity' task sends the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway0' which connects to 'Insurance necessary?' gateway. If insurance is deemed necessary, the 'Complete insurance' task is triggered, sending the goods to 'ExclusiveGateway2' again. The 'Filling the package note' task is then performed at 'ExclusiveGateway2', and the goods are finally sent to 'ParallelGateway4' as 'Goods for collection ready'. This marks the end of the process.
