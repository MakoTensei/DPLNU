 In the bustling world of case management, a series of tasks and gateways work in harmony to ensure a smooth and efficient process. Let's dive into the flow of events:

1. The process begins with a Regression event, which triggers the 'Send a message' task. This task is responsible for communicating with the relevant parties and initiating the next steps in the case management process.

2. The 'Send a message' task sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is designed to handle incoming Regression claims justified? messages. If the Regression claim is justified, the task proceeds to create an appointment for resubmission.

3. Concurrently, the 'Send a message' task also sends a message to the 'EventBasedGateway4', which is responsible for handling incoming notifications.

4. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' receives the Regression claim justified? message and, if the claim is justified, it sends a message to the 'Case closing' task. This task marks the case as closed and sends a message to the 'Regression\ncompleted' gateway.

5. If the Regression claim is not justified, the 'ExclusiveGateway1' sends a message to the 'Create an appointment for resubmission' task, which creates an appointment for resubmission.

6. The 'Create an appointment for resubmission' task sends a message to the 'ExclusiveGateway1' to complete the Regression process.

7. The 'EventBasedGateway4' receives the notification message and sends a message to the 'Delivered to debt collection service provider' task, which marks the case as delivered to the debt collection service provider and completes the Regression process.

8. The 'Case closing' task receives the justified Regression claim message and sends a message to the 'Regression\ncompleted' gateway to complete the Regression process.

9. The 'Regression\ncompleted' gateway receives the messages from the 'Create an appointment for resubmission' and 'Case closing' tasks, completing the Regression process.

10. The 'Book money receipt' task receives the Regression completed message and completes the
