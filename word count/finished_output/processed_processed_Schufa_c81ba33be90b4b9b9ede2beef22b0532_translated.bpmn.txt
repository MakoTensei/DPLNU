 In a scoring process, the system initiates with the 'Start Scoring' event, which triggers the 'Consultation will be determined?' gateway, leading to the 'perform scoring level 1' task. This task, upon completion, sends a 'Scoring result sent' message to the 'IntermediateCatchEvent2' gateway. Concurrently, the 'Start Scoring' event also triggers the 'Result already?' gateway, which, if the result is not yet sent, leads to the 'perform scoring level 2' task. This task, upon completion, sends a 'Scoring result sent' message to the 'Determining scoring level 2' gateway. Finally, the 'Scoring result sent' message is sent to the 'Scoring result sent' end event, completing the scoring process.
