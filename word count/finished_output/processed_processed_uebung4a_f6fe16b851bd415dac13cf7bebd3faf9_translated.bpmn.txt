 In the credit request process, the system starts with a 'Credit request' event, which triggers the 'Schufascore wins' task. This task then leads to an 'Inquiries in Schufscore' task, which in turn connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway1'. The 'ExclusiveGateway1' task directs the flow to the 'Schufa known' task.

Simultaneously, a 'Scoring request' event initiates the 'Level 1 present' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task then leads to 'Scoring ends' and 'Results Level 1 Report'.

When the 'Credit request' event occurs, the 'Schufa known' task is also triggered, which is connected to the 'Delay?' task. The 'Delay?' task leads to 'Level 1 successful?' task, which in turn connects to 'Results Level 1 Report'.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request' event triggers the 'Level 1 present' task, which connects to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' task then leads to 'Scoring ends' and 'Results Level 2 report'.

The 'Request available' event triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway4' task, which connects to 'Results Level 2 report' and 'Scoring ends'.

In summary, the credit request process involves multiple tasks and gateways, including 'Schufascore wins', 'Inquiries in Schufscore', 'ExclusiveGateway1', 'Schufa known', 'Scoring request', 'Level 1 present', 'ExclusiveGateway2', 'Scoring ends', 'Results Level 1 Report', 'Delay?', 'Level 1 successful?', 'Results Level 2 report', and 'ExclusiveGateway4'. These tasks and gateways work together to process the credit request and provide the necessary credit information.
