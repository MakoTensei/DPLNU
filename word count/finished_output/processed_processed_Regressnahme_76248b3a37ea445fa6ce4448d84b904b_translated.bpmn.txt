 When a possibility arises that a vendor (VN) may be in regress, the system initiates a series of tasks and gateways to handle the situation. The process begins with the 'Possibility that VN in Regress taken' event, which triggers the 'Regression requirement' gateway. This gateway has two outcomes: 'EndEvent0' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent5'. The 'EndEvent0' leads to the 'Proceedings' task, while 'IntermediateCatchEvent5' connects to the 'Opposition' task.

The 'Proceedings' task then proceeds to the 'Check the case' task, which in turn leads to the 'Payment Report' task. The 'Payment Report' task has two outcomes: 'EndEvent1' and'sid-2F9FA6B4-E376-408C-BF95-06036A55572C'. The 'EndEvent1' leads to the 'Book payment' task, while the other outcome connects to the 'EndEvent2' task.

The 'Opposition' task, on the other hand, leads to the 'Opposition justified' task, which has two outcomes: 'EndEvent2' and'sid-6001477F-422D-4ADE-8AE8-7D26490D14B1'. The 'EndEvent2' leads to the 'EndEvent2' task, while the other outcome connects to the 'EndEvent3' task.

In summary, the system handles the possibility of a vendor in regress by initiating a series of tasks and gateways, leading to different outcomes based on the situation. The 'Proceedings' task checks the case and generates a 'Payment Report', while the 'Opposition' task justifies the opposition. The system concludes with the 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3' tasks.
