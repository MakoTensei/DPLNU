 The process begins with an 'Order to receive' event, which triggers the 'Check order quantity' task to ensure the desired quantity is available. This task communicates with 'ParallelGateway6' to coordinate the pickup of offers.

Simultaneously, 'Pick up offers 3 spediteurs' task is initiated, which sends offers to 'Offers go' gateway. This gateway then forwards the offers to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which is responsible for handling the offers.

Once the offers are received at 'ExclusiveGateway1', the 'Offers go' task is completed, and the offers are sent to 'ParallelGateway6' for further processing.

The 'Order Sped 1' task is triggered next, which sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. This gateway then sends the order to 'ExclusiveGateway5', which is responsible for the next step in the process.

Meanwhile, 'Order Sped 2' and 'Order Sped 3' tasks are also initiated, sending their respective orders to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. These orders are then forwarded to 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway2' respectively.

The 'Preparation for collection' task is triggered, which sends the order to 'ParallelGateway7'. This gateway then sends the order to 'Order completed' gateway, marking the end of the process.

Throughout the process, the 'Insurance required?' task is triggered, sending the order to 'ExclusiveGateway4'. This gateway then forwards the order to 'Complete insurance' gateway, which sends the insurance information to 'ExclusiveGateway5'.

Finally, the 'Filling the package note' task is initiated, sending the insurance information to 'ExclusiveGateway5'. This gateway then sends the package note to 'ParallelGateway7', which completes the process by sending the order to 'Order completed' gateway.

In summary, the process involves several tasks and gateways working together to handle orders, offers, and insurance requirements, ultimately leading to the completion of the order.
