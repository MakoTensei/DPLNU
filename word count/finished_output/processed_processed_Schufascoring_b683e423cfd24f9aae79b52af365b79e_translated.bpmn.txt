 In the process of requesting a soring service, the system initiates with 'StartEvent0', which triggers 'IntermediateCatchEvent1'. This event then leads to 'IntermediateCatchEvent2', which in turn results in 'EndEvent0'. Meanwhile, 'Request Schufaservice' is caught by 'IntermediateCatchEvent3', which concludes with 'EndEvent0'. If there is a delay, 'Report delay' is triggered, which can either lead to 'Level 1 Scoring' or 'EndEvent1', depending on the situation. 'Level 1 Scoring' is initiated by 'StartEvent1' and concludes with 'EndEvent1'. In case of a delay, 'Level 2 Soring perform' is triggered, which also ends with 'EndEvent1'. Additionally, 'Score available?' is a gateway that can lead to 'EndEvent1' after 'StartEvent1'.
