 In the process of handling a legal case, the workflow begins with the event 'Regress possible', which triggers the 'Check regression case' task. This task is directed towards 'ExclusiveGateway1', which then connects to the 'Regress check completed' task upon successful completion of the regression check.

Simultaneously, the 'Book payment' task is initiated when an 'Incoming payment' event occurs, leading to 'ExclusiveGateway1'. If the payment is justified, the 'Rejection of payment justified?' task is triggered, which in turn leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'.

The 'Proceedings' task is activated by the 'Incoming objection' event, directing it towards 'ExclusiveGateway3'. If the objection is accepted, the 'Close the process' task is initiated.

The 'Default period expired' event also leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3', which can result in the 'Close the process' task if the default period has indeed expired.

Lastly, the 'debt collection order executed' event leads to 'ExclusiveGateway1', which can result in the 'Regression check completed' task if the debt collection order has been executed.

Overall, the process involves a series of tasks and gateways that are triggered by specific events, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow in handling legal cases.
