 The process begins with a 'Scoring request' event, which triggers the 'Scoring request Level 1' task. This task then sends a 'Report delay' message to the 'Waiting for result' gateway, indicating that the scoring process is underway.

Simultaneously, the 'Scoring request Level 1' task also sends a 'forward scoring level 1' message to the 'forward result to the frontend' gateway. This gateway, in turn, sends a 'Process completed' message to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Process completed' message and sends it back to the 'Scoring request Level 1' task, completing the first part of the process.

Meanwhile, the 'Scoring request Level 1' task also sends a 'Results available?' message to the 'Results available?' gateway. This gateway receives the message and sends a 'Process completed' message to both the 'Waiting for result' gateway and the 'forward result to the frontend' gateway.

The 'forward result to the frontend' gateway then sends a 'Process completed' message to the 'Send a reply' gateway, which in turn sends a 'Process completed' message to the 'Scoring request Level 1' task, completing the first part of the process.

The 'Scoring request Level 1' task also sends a 'forward scoring level 2' message to the 'Evaluate scoring level 2' gateway. This gateway receives the message and sends a 'Process completed' message to the 'Send a reply' gateway.

The 'Send a reply' gateway then sends a 'Process completed' message to the 'Scoring request Level 1' task, completing the second part of the process.

Finally, the 'Scoring request Level 1' task sends a 'Results available?' message to the 'Results available?' gateway, which receives the message and sends a 'Process completed' message to the 'EventBasedGateway1'.

The 'EventBasedGateway1' receives the 'Process completed' message and sends it back to the 'Scoring request Level 1' task, completing the entire process.
