 The process begins with the 'Goods are to be shipped' task, which triggers the 'Packaging goods' task. The 'Packaging goods' task then sends the 'Goods are to be shipped' information to the 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn triggers the 'Select your offer' task. The 'Select your offer' task sends the 'Goods are to be shipped' information to the 'ExclusiveGateway0' again, which then triggers the 'Appoint forwarding' task. The 'Appoint forwarding' task sends the 'Select your offer' information to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then triggers the 'Filling the package note' task. The 'Filling the package note' task sends the 'Select your offer' information to the 'ExclusiveGateway2' once more, which then triggers the 'Complete insurance' task. The 'Complete insurance' task sends the 'Insurance desired?' information to the 'ExclusiveGateway2', which then triggers the 'EndEvent0' task. The 'EndEvent0' task sends the 'Goods delivered' and 'Filling the package note' information to the 'ParallelGateway4', which then triggers the 'EndEvent0' task.
