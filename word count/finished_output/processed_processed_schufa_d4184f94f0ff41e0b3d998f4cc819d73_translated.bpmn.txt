 In a seamless workflow, the process begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Share delay' task, followed by the 'Request scoring' task that initiates the scoring process. The 'Scoring 1' task then kicks off, leading to an 'IntermediateCatchEvent4' that captures the intermediate results. Concurrently, the 'Submitting results' task is initiated by 'StartEvent1', which eventually leads to 'EndEvent2'. Meanwhile, the 'Scoring 2' task is triggered by 'IntermediateCatchEvent4', culminating in the 'Send Final Results' task. The 'EndEvent0' and 'EndEvent1' tasks are managed by the 'EventBasedGateway0', while 'EndEvent2' and 'EndEvent3' are handled by 'EventBasedGateway1'. The 'Result' task concludes the scoring process, and the 'Delay' task manages the time-sensitive aspects of the workflow.
