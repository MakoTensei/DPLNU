 Let's walk through the process of shipping a big shipment, ensuring insurance coverage, and handling the logistics:

1. When you receive shipping costs, you initiate the process by checking the quantity of the shipment.
2. To ensure the shipment is insured, you check if insurance is necessary.
3. If insurance is required, you fill out the package note and check the insurance requirements.
4. You then offer Spediteur 1 in-house for the shipment.
5. After the offer is accepted, you select the freight forwarder and commission them.
6. The freight forwarder checks if a big shipment is involved and routes the process to ExclusiveGateway 2.
7. At ExclusiveGateway 2, you check the insurance requirements and route the process to ExclusiveGateway 3.
8. ExclusiveGateway 3 handles the insurance and sends the shipment to ParallelGateway 7.
9. Once the shipment reaches ParallelGateway 7, you deliver the goods and finalize the shipping costs.

This process ensures that the big shipment is handled efficiently, with insurance coverage and proper logistics management.
