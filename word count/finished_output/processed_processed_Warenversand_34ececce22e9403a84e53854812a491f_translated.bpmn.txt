 When goods are to be sent, the process begins with an invitation to mail order, which is facilitated by ParallelGateway5. This gateway then connects to ExclusiveGateway1, which is triggered by the 'Big crowd?' event. ExclusiveGateway1, in turn, leads to the requirement for insurance, which is handled by Insurance Gateway. Once insurance is confirmed, the process moves to ExclusiveGateway3, which is also triggered by 'Big crowd?' and 'Insurance'. ExclusiveGateway3 then leads to the pickup of packaged goods, which is facilitated by ParallelGateway4. ParallelGateway4 connects back to ParallelGateway5, which was initially responsible for sending the goods. This entire process ensures that goods are sent, insured, and picked up efficiently, even in the event of a big crowd.
