 When a 'Message received' event occurs, it triggers the 'Send payment request' process, which then leads to the creation of a representation. This representation can prompt a regress possibility check, which, if affirmative, connects to the 'Reimbursement Call' process. The 'Reimbursement Call' may result in a 'Money there?' inquiry, which, if positive, leads to the 'donate to debt collection' action. Concurrently, the 'Opposition obtained' event can also trigger the 'ExclusiveGateway3' process. Both the 'donate to debt collection' and 'ExclusiveGateway3' processes eventually converge at the 'Process completed' stage, where the case is closed.
