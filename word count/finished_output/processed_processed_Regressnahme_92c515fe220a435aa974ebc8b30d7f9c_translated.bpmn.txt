 The process begins with the event 'possible regression against VN', which triggers the task 'Check the procedure' to determine if a regression is possible. If a regression is possible, the task 'Send VN payment request' is initiated to handle the situation.

Next, the task 'Set process for resubmission' is triggered by the 'Money received' event, which occurs after the 'Send VN payment request' task. This task sets up the process for resubmission.

The 'Regress possible?' event then triggers the 'Set process for resubmission' task, which leads to the 'Regression carried out' event. This event signifies that a regression has been executed.

Following the 'Regression carried out' event, the 'Book entrance and close operation' task is initiated, which results in the 'Regression carried out' event.

The 'Customer against' event triggers the 'Close' task, which concludes the process.

Finally, the 'Regress possible?' event triggers the 'Transfer to Incas Service Provider' task, which leads to the 'Regression carried out' event.

In summary, the process starts with a possible regression against VN, which leads to a series of tasks and events that ultimately result in a regression being carried out.
