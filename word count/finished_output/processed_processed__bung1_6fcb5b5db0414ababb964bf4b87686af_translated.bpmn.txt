This task is connected to the 'ParallelGateway3', which in turn leads to the 'Special delivery necessary?' task. The 'Special delivery necessary?' task has two outgoing paths: 'ExclusiveGateway2' and 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'ExclusiveGateway2' then connects to the 'Filling the package note' task, which also has two outgoing paths: 'ParallelGateway4' and 'ParallelGateway4'.
