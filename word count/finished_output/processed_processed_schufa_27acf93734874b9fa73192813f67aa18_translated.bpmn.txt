 When a request is received by the Frontend, it triggers a series of events and interactions between different components in the system. The process begins with the 'Request Frontend obtained' event, which initiates the 'Scoring Result to Frontend' task. This task is responsible for determining the scoring result and passing it back to the Frontend.

Once the scoring result is obtained, the 'First scoring successful?' gateway is triggered. If the scoring is successful, the 'EndEvent1' event is generated, marking the completion of the first scoring process.

If the scoring is successful, the 'Report back delay' task is triggered, which sends a 'Second scoring request obtained' event to the system. This event initiates the 'Second scoring request obtained' task, which requests a second scoring process.

The 'Second scoring request obtained' task triggers the 'Second scoring request necessary?' gateway, which determines if a second scoring is necessary. If a second scoring is required, the 'EndEvent2' event is generated, marking the completion of the second scoring process.

If a second scoring is not necessary, the 'Second scoring request obtained' task triggers the 'Second scoring request obtained' task again, which sends a 'First scoring successful?' event to the system. This event triggers the 'First scoring successful?' gateway, which determines if a first scoring was successful.

If the first scoring was successful, the 'EndEvent0' event is generated, marking the completion of the first scoring process.

In summary, the system processes a request received by the Frontend by determining the scoring result, reporting any delays, and potentially initiating a second scoring process. The process is completed through a series of events and interactions between tasks, gateways, and start/end events.
