 The process begins with the 'StartEvent0' triggering the 'Delay occurred?' gateway, which then leads to the 'Conduct scoring (level 1)' task. This task is completed, resulting in 'EndEvent2'. Concurrently, the 'StartEvent1' initiates the 'Scoring investigation immediately possible?' gateway, which in turn leads to 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' and 'EndEvent2'. The 'Conduct scoring (level 2)' task is completed, and the 'Scoring completed' event is triggered. Meanwhile, the 'ParallelGateway2' gateway, triggered by 'StartEvent0', leads to 'ParallelGateway3' and 'IntermediateCatchEvent4'. The 'ParallelGateway3' then leads to the 'Process completed' event.
