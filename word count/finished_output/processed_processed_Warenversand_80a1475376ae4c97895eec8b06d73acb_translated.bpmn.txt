 The shipping process begins with the 'Start' event, which triggers the 'Collection of offers from different carriers' task. This task is responsible for gathering various carrier options. Once the carrier options are collected, the 'ExclusiveGateway3' gateway receives the 'Large quantity' incoming, which then leads to the 'Delivering goods' task.

The 'Filling the package note' task, which requires a 'Large quantity' input, sends its output to the 'ParallelGateway5'. This gateway, in turn, connects to the 'Delivering goods' task, completing the shipping process.

Throughout the process, the 'Insurance necessary?' task, which is triggered by the 'Large quantity' input, sends its output to the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This gateway then connects to the 'ExclusiveGateway3', which is responsible for handling the 'Large quantity' input and ultimately leading to the 'Delivering goods' task.

In summary, the shipping process involves collecting carrier options, filling the package note, and delivering the goods, with various tasks and gateways working together to ensure a smooth and efficient process.
