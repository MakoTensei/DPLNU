 When a regression case is reported, the process begins with checking the case (sid-A8AA11AE-CAF5-4061-BF59-C4F46EF8E66E) which then leads to sending a payment request (sid-8E1B1ACD-1BDD-403D-B42D-1DA8E6DD7F91) due to the possibility of a regressive challenge (sid-18160E75-CD4A-45A9-812E-22EBD746AAC7). If the regressive challenge is justified, the case is closed (sid-D2A3F685-65DC-4000-AF1A-3D989F34368E).

If the regressive challenge is not justified, the case is forwarded to ExclusiveGateway1 (sid-8D346B9C-48A8-4E99-993D-38D046D69D16) where it can either be closed (sid-16EA0F70-4B5B-4183-9F05-3F5E4AAE41DA) or lead to a payment request (sid-64C87A61-919F-40D7-B015-DF07171DB5FE) if a payment is needed.

If a payment is made, the process continues with ExclusiveGateway1 (sid-8D346B9C-48A8-4E99-993D-38D046D69D16) which can either close the case (sid-D2A3F685-65DC-4000-AF1A-3D989F34368E) or forward it to the Debt collection service provider (sid-4B731DF2-9831-4792-9436-
