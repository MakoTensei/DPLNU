 When a shipment event occurs, the system initiates a sequence of tasks to process the shipment. First, the system prompts the user to select the type of shipping. Once the shipping type is determined, the system checks the shipping mode. After that, the user is asked to pick three offers. The selected offer is then communicated to an exclusive gateway, which further directs the process to either initiate normal mail or fill a standardized parcel note, depending on the shipping mode.

If insurance is deemed necessary, the system prompts the user to confirm this and directs the information to an exclusive gateway that handles insurance-related tasks. The system then proceeds to packaging the goods, which is followed by providing the goods for collection.

Throughout this process, the system communicates with various gateways to ensure the smooth flow of tasks. The exclusive gateways handle specific tasks such as selecting offers, checking shipping modes, and determining the necessity of insurance. The parallel gateways manage the flow of shipments and goods, ensuring that the goods are made available for collection.

In summary, the system processes a shipment event by guiding the user through a series of tasks, including selecting shipping type, checking shipping mode, picking offers, determining insurance necessity, packaging goods, and providing goods for collection. The system communicates with exclusive and parallel gateways to ensure the efficient handling of these tasks.
