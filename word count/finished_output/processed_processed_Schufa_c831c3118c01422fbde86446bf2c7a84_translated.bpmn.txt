 In the process of scoring, the system begins with the 'StartEvent0' which triggers the 'Overmittling Scoring' task. This task then sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway0', which in turn leads to the 'Delay' task. The 'Delay' task, upon completion, sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway0' again, which then leads to the 'Conclusion' task.

Simultaneously, the 'StartEvent1' task initiates the 'Scoring' task, which sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. The 'Scoring' task then sends a message to 'ExclusiveGateway2' again, leading to the 'EndEvent1' task.

The 'Conclusion' task is connected to 'EndEvent0' through 'ExclusiveGateway0', while the 'EndEvent1' task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1' through 'StartEvent1'.

In summary, the scoring process starts with 'StartEvent0', which leads to 'Overmittling Scoring' and 'Delay'. The 'Delay' task then leads to the 'Conclusion' task. Concurrently, 'StartEvent1' leads to 'Scoring' and 'EndEvent1'. The 'Conclusion' task is connected to 'EndEvent0' and the 'EndEvent1' task is connected to 'ExclusiveGateway1'.
