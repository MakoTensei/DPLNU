 In the process of checking for regression possibilities, the system starts with the event 'Regression potential possible' which triggers the 'ExclusiveGateway2'. This event is then followed by the 'Manufactured' task, which sends a message to the 'Debt collection service provider' and 'Process closed'. Concurrently, the 'Regress possibility' task is initiated, leading to the 'Process closed' event after 14 days. The 'Payment entry' task is also triggered, resulting in the 'Process closed' event. Finally, the 'Process closed' event concludes the entire process.
