 In the logistics process, goods are first received at ParallelGateway4, where they are picked up for collection. The goods are then shipped, and the type of shipping is determined at the Type of Shipping Gateway. Depending on the shipping type, the goods may be insured, and if so, they are processed through ExclusiveGateway1, which can lead to either an EndEvent0 or the Fill Standard Package Voucher process.

If the goods are not insured, they proceed to ParallelGateway5, where they can be selected for an offer. Once an offer is selected, the goods are shipped, and the shipping type is determined again at the Type of Shipping Gateway. The shipping type can lead to either an EndEvent0 or the Fill Standard Package Voucher process, depending on whether the goods are insured.

In the case of insurance, the goods are processed through ExclusiveGateway3, which can lead to either ParallelGateway5 or the EndEvent0. If the goods are not insured, they proceed to ParallelGateway5, where they can be selected for an offer.

Finally, once the goods are shipped and the offer is selected, the process concludes at EndEvent0.
