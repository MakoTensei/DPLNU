 When a person feels hunger, they enter the "Entry Restaurant" gateway, which triggers the process of adding their order. This order is then sent to the "Court of Justice" gateway, where it is selected. The selected order is then passed to the "Add your order" task, which prompts the person to place their order.

Once the order is placed, it is sent to the "Pay" gateway, where the person pays for their meal. The payment is then processed, and the order is handed over to the "scaling and pie hand over" task. This task involves preparing the meal according to the order details.

The prepared meal is then sent to the "Cook information" gateway, where the cook receives the order details. The cook then proceeds to prepare the meal, which is sent to the "Meals into the kingdom" task. This task involves the meal being prepared and ready to be served.

The prepared meal is then sent to the "Employees information" gateway, where the employees receive the order details. The employees then proceed to prepare the meal, which is sent to the "Meals Prepared" task.

Finally, the meal is served, and the "Order Date" event is triggered, marking the completion of the process.
