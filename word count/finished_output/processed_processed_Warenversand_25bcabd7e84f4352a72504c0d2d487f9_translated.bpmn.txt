 When a shipment is desired, the process begins at the 'Shipment Desired' event, which triggers the 'Exclusive Gateway 2' to handle the incoming request. This gateway then routes the request to the 'Offers Select' task, which requires a 'Large Lot?' inquiry. The 'Large Lot?' inquiry is handled by the 'Large Lot?' gateways, which in turn directs the request to the 'Specialist' task. The 'Specialist' task, upon receiving the 'Large Lot?' inquiry, sends the request to the 'Exclusive Gateway 3'.

Simultaneously, the 'Exclusive Gateway 2' also handles the 'Insurance Required?' inquiry, which is received from the 'Shipment Desired' event. This inquiry is directed to the 'Insurance Close' task, which then sends the request to the 'Parallel Gateway 5'.

Once the 'Specialist' task completes the 'Large Lot?' inquiry, it sends the request to the 'Parallel Gateway 5', which is also the outgoing gateway for the 'Insurance Close' task. The 'Parallel Gateway 5' then dispatches the goods, completing the process and ending at the 'Goods Dispatched' event.
