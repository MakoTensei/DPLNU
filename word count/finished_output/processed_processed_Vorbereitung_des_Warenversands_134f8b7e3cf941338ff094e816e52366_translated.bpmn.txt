 Upon receiving shipping costs, the process begins with a Quantity Check to determine the required shipping amount. This check is facilitated by the ParallelGateway3, which then connects to ExclusiveGateway0. At ExclusiveGateway0, the system decides whether to proceed with insurance or to pick up offers from three carriers. If insurance is chosen, the process moves to ParallelGateway4, where insurance requirements are assessed. Conversely, if picking up offers is the chosen path, the system selects the best offer and proceeds to ExclusiveGateway0 again.


Once the offer is selected, the process continues to ParallelGateway4, where the goods are prepared for collection. This final step concludes the process, with the goods ready for collection.


Here's the flow described in a more natural and understandable way:


1. The process starts when shipping costs are obtained.

2. A Quantity Check is initiated to determine the shipping amount.

3. The Quantity Check connects to ParallelGateway3.

4. At ParallelGateway3, the system decides to either proceed with insurance or to pick up offers from three carriers.

5. If insurance is chosen, the process moves to ParallelGateway4, where insurance requirements are assessed.

6. If picking up offers is the chosen path, the system selects the best offer and proceeds to ParallelGateway4.

7. At ParallelGateway4, the goods are prepared for collection.

8. The process concludes with the goods ready for collection.
