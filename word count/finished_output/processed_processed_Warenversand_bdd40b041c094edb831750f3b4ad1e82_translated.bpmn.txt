 In the order fulfillment process, incoming orders trigger a StartEvent0, which initiates a series of tasks. The first task, 'Incoming orders', is received by the ExclusiveGateway0 and subsequently sends parallel tasks to ParallelGateway4 and ExclusiveGateway1. The 'Request a quote' task, initiated by StartEvent0, is directed to ExclusiveGateway0 and then to ParallelGateway3.

ParallelGateway3, in turn, sends tasks to both ExclusiveGateway1 and itself, while ParallelGateway2, receiving StartEvent0, sends tasks to ParallelGateway4 and EndEvent0. The 'Select offers' task, triggered by ExclusiveGateway1, also goes to ParallelGateway4.

ParallelGateway4, the central hub, receives tasks from Incoming orders, Request a quote, Select offers, Packaging goods, and Insurance. It then sends tasks to EndEvent0. The 'Packaging goods' task, originating from StartEvent0, is directed to ParallelGateway2, which sends tasks to ParallelGateway4 and EndEvent0.

The'make offer' task, initiated by StartEvent0, is sent to ExclusiveGateway1, which in turn sends tasks to ParallelGateway3. ParallelGateway3 sends tasks to ExclusiveGateway1 and itself.

Finally, EndEvent0, triggered by ParallelGateway2 and ParallelGateway4, completes the process.
