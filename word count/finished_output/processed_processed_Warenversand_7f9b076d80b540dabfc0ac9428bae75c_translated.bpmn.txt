 In a manufacturing process, the task of packaging goods is initiated by the 'StartEvent0' and is received by 'ParallelGateway5'. This task then proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway3', where the user is prompted to choose their favorite packaging option. Concurrently, the task of providing for collection is also initiated by 'StartEvent0' and is received by 'ParallelGateway5', which then leads to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. Meanwhile, the task of filling in packaging paper is triggered by 'Order clarification (gross/small)' and is received by 'ParallelGateway5', which then proceeds to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Similarly, the task of insurance close is initiated by 'Order clarification (gross/small)' and is received by 'ParallelGateway5', leading to 'ExclusiveGateway2'. Both tasks of filling in packaging paper and insurance close are then sent to 'ExclusiveGateway3'. The tasks of packaging goods and providing for collection are then sent to 'ParallelGateway4', while the task of insurance close is sent to 'EndEvent0'. Finally, the process concludes with 'EndEvent0', which is triggered by 'Insurance required' and has no outgoing connections.
